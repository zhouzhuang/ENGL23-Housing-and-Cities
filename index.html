This week’s lecture video, “Housing and Cities,” truly helped me to view cities with a new lense. Growing up just outside of San Francisco, one of the largest cities in California, my idea of a city was one of bustling people, consumerism, and chaos, with no sense of environmentalism whatsoever. However, as explained in Ken’s video, this is not the case; city living can be extremely impactful in reducing someone’s individual climate footprint. Among other things, commute is shortened and housing is smaller, resulting in significantly less consumption of natural resources and fewer carbon emissions. While I appreciate the idea behind this, I feel as if city living may be a challenging transition for many people. Although I didn’t grow up in San Francisco, I have a very good sense of the city’s nearly constant mayhem, and because of this, I have always been grateful to not be in the middle of it.

Cities seemingly destroy the idea of being close to nature, and without a connection to the natural world, many people can become overwhelmed by persistent hubbub and craziness. Because of this, in order for anyone to be able to live in a city, they must have outlets to some form of nature. Whether it’s a rooftop garden or a peaceful area surrounded by trees, the positive influence that nature can create is essential to urban life. For example, my mom works in San Francisco and spends much of her week in an office. Fortunately for her, the building next to hers has a rooftop garden with a small cafe and lots of seating for anyone to enjoy. When the chaos of the city and confinement of her office space begin to hinder her work performance, she goes to this rooftop and is secluded from the urban world around her, therefore enabling her to relax and enjoy being where she is, without dealing with the commotion of her city life.

I find your point about city's alienating people form nature very accurate. As someone raised on city suburbs, I was always used to having a lot of space to move about, run in the garden, play with my dogs etc. While I have tried for some time now to taylor my life to be more environmentally conscious (palnt-based diet, recycling, cycling, limited consumption, having a small set of clothes) the notion of the big house had escaped me before Ken's class. It just really makes me think how I could convince myself assuming I am in good economic standing to live in a small city apartment, even co-house instead of out in the suburbs, where my kids could play with the dogs and each other, and grow up somewhere peaceful, exactly like I did. I don't know as of yet if I have the answer, but there will definitely need to be more well-designed nature havens within cities if we are to be happy and healthy living in them.

Very similar to you, one conception of what a living environment should look like is pretty much those mega-cities in the world are composed of. Growing up in Beijing, the capital city of China, with a population of over 23 million people, I have always perceived an enjoyable life as the one in such a large city, with dense population, social diversity, consumerism and recreational places. However, taking this course makes me realize how those mega-cities are the carbon tanks in our world. Bigger. At this time, we want everything to be bigger. Bigger means better. This is absolutely scary. Professor Hiltner has pointed out that, as the American population decreases, the average area of housing increases. In fact, do we actually need this much space just to support our basic needs for everyday life? Compared to the example of the traditional Japanese home, the answer is no. It seems that our human nature is always desiring more than we need. This is where I think the change should really come from. Drawing from my experience and understanding, I believe there must be a cultural change in people’s fixed mindset in order to bring light to this situation. We should start focusing on what is needed, instead of the endless desire of what we want.

I find your point about cities being unnatural interesting. I used to have the same opinion until one day, when I was having a conversation with my friend. He pointed out that humans and their mannerisms are a part of nature, and thus, cities are a natural landscape that's created by animals. Think of a beaver dam. Since I heard that, cities are much more beautiful to me. The fact that we have done all of this and made it accessible is beautiful. I think city life is a dream for many, living in a cozy little apartment and walking wherever they want to go. It's convenient, and it's cute. It takes less time and money to warm up your house. You spend more time in close local places, and establish community relations. Cities are a beautiful part of human nature, and an incredible landscape in and of themselves.
<br><br>
I find the drive to naturalize cities very powerful. My boyfriend grew up in Washington D.C., which he often refers to as a "green city." The city has protected local green space for its whole history, and it has been protected as long as the U.S. has had protections for parks. Driving through the city, you feel like you're in the jungle. For a girl from drought struck California, it's magical. There are plants everywhere. It's an incredible feeling to be around so many people and also in so much nature.

Just like you, I also learn to view the cities with a new lense after watching this week's video. At first glance, it is correct to view cities as in no sense similar to nature as there are chaos, fewer greens, and more people. However, it is also essential to change our ingrained opinions as the world is developing. Now, we would have the ability to change and set a new tone for cities. Ken is definitely right about the data for housing costs, housing sizes, and the car uses in mega-cities, which I believe is the most direct evidence of showing the benefits of living in a city. It is also interesting to learn that as new generations, we should rethink the image of cities. As people are moving to suburbs to seek a simpler life and more greens in the era of back-to-nature movement, they have brought tremendous negative consequences to nature. The untouched and uncontaminated areas are now becoming disastrous, which leads us to think that cities may be the new key to solve the climate and environmental issues. As the population gets larger and larger, it is necessary to think about a new way of lifestyle that binds people and the cities which can fill a large population.

In comparison to you, I actually live in San Francisco and I can tell you that living in the city isn’t as bad as people say it is. Since San Francisco isn’t that big of a city, there are a lot of public transportations available throughout the city and I actually think that the city requires more because, during rush hours, the muni becomes packed with people. I think they need to know when to have busses come more frequently due to the timing. With the muni, which is what we call the busses, we can go anywhere in the city but the bus passes have increased in prices which is a little annoying. We also have the bart if we want to travel to neighboring cities but those are much more expensive but really fast because they travel underground and not with other cars. In addition, I know a lot of people in Southern California that have a huge house that I am not used to in San Francisco because space is so limited. My friends always tell me that the houses in San Francisco are small and I always reply with that’s because San Francisco is a small city. I also agree with Ken’s point about how people are moving into urban areas because recently, rent in San Francisco has been increasing due to more people moving in so homeowners are raising the prices so they can profit from this. 
<br><br>


I am actually super grateful that I grew up in San Francisco because I realized that my carbon footprint is a lot less than other people which makes me feel a little less guilty of my carbon emission. My friend has always talked about being carbon emission friendly but still, drive around for everything and she tells me not to do certain things because it isn’t eco-friendly when she contradicts herself. So learning that my carbon emission isn’t as bad as I thought makes me feel better but I will definitely limit my carbon emission.

I think your comment is really important because city living does have to be rethought - how can it appeal to everybody and still keep our environmental impact low? I grew up in Los Angeles, which is probably the worst environmental city ever. Most of the houses are gigantic, with big yards too, and the suburbs spread for so many miles in all directions that most people have to commute extremely long distances, made even worse by the traffic and pretty much impossible to escape because the public transportation doesn’t reach most neighborhoods and is already full and inefficient. Whenever I go home, I have to drive every day to get anywhere, unlike in Isla Vista. It is also extremely dangerous and difficult to bike in LA because of the traffic and hilly roads. Also because of LA’s (frankly idiotic) design, we are experiencing a horrible housing and homelessness crisis because the only thing we have are expensive houses and the only thing being built are more expensive houses.
<br><br>

This all needs to change if we want to tackle the climate crisis. Way more people need to start living in these houses and use the land around the houses for sustainable food, and apartment buildings need to be built around public transportation. However, this is made much more difficult again because the communities who live in LA now, mostly wealthy, white, and older people, are actively campaigning against any low-income housing. They think it will “ruin the integrity of their communities,” aka they’re classist. All of these systems interconnect and we have to build up the idea with people, not just politicians/city planners, that the best way to live is small.
<br><hr>

I completely agree with everything said in your comment. I am especially connected to the part where you spoke about seeing cities through a new lense, I myself have had a complete change in perspective regarding city life after this course. Before coming to UCSB, I was content living in a small town far from the hustle and bustle of any big cities. I thought that my distance from these concrete jungles brought me closer to nature and made me even more of an “environmentalist” than someone in Los Angeles for example. Only now do I realize that where I live (and the way in which I live) is actually quite detrimental to the health of our planet. 
<br><br>
The home where my family lives is, looking back now, simply way too big! Although I appreciate that my parents want my sister and I to have our own spaces, it’s completely unnecessary and I find myself spending time in the same two places of an oversized house. As a child, I dreamt of living in some huge mansion on acres of land, now that idea makes me sick. After this class, and this lecture in particular, I am certain that as an adult I would like to live a much more environmentally conscious life, starting with where I live. I’m so glad we have been exposed to information on more sustainable housing such as tiny houses or micro apartments, and I hope in the future I can proudly say that I live in a space appropriate for the size of my family.
<br><hr>
Like you, I too viewed cities as the epitome of what we shouldn't be a part of. With corporations, factories, businesses, it just paints the image of a concentrated area of all of our faults in the climate crisis. But by the way Ken puts it in this video, it actually serves as the opposite. My sister has lived in New York for 5 years now, and I can clearly see all the ways Ken describes a decreased climate footprint in her daily lifestyle. My sister walks or takes the subway to run errands. She almost never uses her car unless she needs to go longer distances that aren't in the subway's route or when she needs to get somewhere quickly. She lives in a fairly small apartment and finds herself cooking at home or eating at local restaurants that practice better food practices than large fast food chains do. Though her lifestyle isn't perfect, she enjoys her routine and I think she exerts less stress on the climate than others, which is a step. 
<br><br>


I think it's really cool that the building next to your mom's has a rooftop garden. I've been to one before in SF and not only is the view great, but it just feel like a hidden gem in the hustle and bustle of the city. If we think about New York again, the nature escape is one of my personal favorite places on earth, Central Park. What an incredible idea to put a gigantic park in the middle of such a busy city. 
<br><br>
After watching the clip about Life Edited in Minimalism regarding micro apartments and thinking about how my sister lives in NYC, I would seriously consider and love to spend a large part of my life living with a few roommates in an NYC micro apartment and really try to honestly reduce my waste and carbon footprint.

<br><hr>
I agree with this comment. This weeks lecture video put cities in a new light. I used to also see cities as these chaotic hubs filled with moguls, entrepreneurs, influencers, and go-getters. People who would stop at nothing to obtain more and reach the top in all levels, especially materialistic ones. Having the luxury to be able to spend a good amount of time in cities like Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Philadelphia, etc. its actually quite easy to see how extremely beneficial it can be to the environment to live in a city. Housing is more sustainable, transportation is, and the consumption levels are actually less as well. I also enjoyed this comment for expressing the idea of how a city can be hectic. Sure people love to make day trips to the city to go check out some landmarks, go shopping, hit the beach, party, etc. although not many people want to be constantly in the city. It can be simply overwhelming. So it is very important to have outlets of nature in cities, especially if you want people to make a shift towards permanent residency in the city.
<br><hr>
I was also surprised by how much less of a carbon footprint we could have by living in the city than in rural areas. I first thought, admittedly without thinking too much on the topic, that we would have a smaller impact on climate change by living somewhere without all the factories, businesses, traffic, etc. But I was wrong. And after seeing this video, it makes total sense. Obviously less commute times, smaller housing, and less resources being used leads to a smaller carbon footprint. And especially in places with great public transportation such as subways, buses, trains, etc. I think that’s an important point many of us don’t really know unless we see a video like this one or really sit down and consider what’s better for the environment. 
<br><br>

I do understand your concern though with how some people really don’t like the “noise” of a big city. Luckily for me, I quite enjoy bigger cities because there’s more to do, more people to interact with, and more options for food, stores, etc. However, I too think we should ensure that those cities have plenty of options and places that have “nature” or that are quiet to allow us to decompress and ground ourselves. I think sometimes the commotion of cities can make it hard to remember what’s important or even what we want. It can sometimes be hard to hear yourself think and I think that’s something we should always have access to. I really enjoyed your post and agree with many of your points. Well said!

<br><hr>
I find it Ironic that environmentalists like Henry David Thoreau and other transcendentalists, decired major population centers of being devoid of nature and were an affront to nature and in some ways they are right cities of the time were hotbeds for disease and were extremely polluted. But now with modern amenities like basic sewage and mass transit systems we see less and less reason to live outside the city and in suburbia. I am a claustrophobe, I love living in large open spaces and even the micro-apartments of today have open space designs that make them seem spacious. I personally love massive cities like SF and their constant bustle.

<br><hr>
I would first just like to say, I have always loved San Francisco but am unsure I could live there. City living can on a base level seem very exciting. I completely acknowledge what Ken discussed about city living being beneficial. Smaller living spaces does allow for better allocation of space and resources within a smaller block or area. Furthermore, public transportation is more widely used and simply easier to use in larger cites. Although these aspects of city living are great, I agree with the point you made about the separation from nature. If you work in an office building all day at a desk and then go home to a small apartment in the heart of the city, you are depriving yourself of the connection and destress that nature provides. Overtime, the human mind needs to unload. Nature and the trees and everything about it literally calm people down and help the mind boost functions and react clearer.
<br><hr>
I agree with you.  I grew up in a very small town about 3 hours north, and my perception of living in a city was always that so much CO2 was released.  I always believed that if you lived in a city such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago etc. then your carbon footprint would be very very high.  After watching Ken's lecture video I have now come to the understanding that my perception is not necessarily true.  Because you live in a city this does not mean that your carbon footprint is going to be very high.  On the contrary it means that it will be reduced.  And this is for the simple fact of public transportation, commuting and biking.  For example, say you live in a massive city such as San Francisco.  I have driven in San Francisco and it is not fun at all, there is so much congestion, so many cars everywhere, the streets are so small, parking is horrible, it is just horrible driving in San Francisco.  Anyways, you have to get to work in the middle of San Francisco everyday.  It could be as short of a distance as 5 minutes away or as far as an hour away.  But either way if you were to drive there the time it would take would most likely be doubled, because of all the cars and traffic.  But there are very easy ways to avoid the stress, and frustration of traffic, and these are public transportation, carpooling, and biking.  Utilizing these very efficient means of transportation reduces your carbon footprint by so much.  And in a city that is populated by so many people, that is so much CO2 that is not being emitted by simply changing your way of transportation.
<br><hr>
Just like you, this week's lecture video helped me to view cities with a new lense. Growing up in Beijing, the capital of China, I always believe these large cities could only have negative impacts on our environment because these large cities mean lots of factories, bustling people, traffic congestion, consumerism, and pollution. However, after watching this video, I learned that city living can be extremely impactful in reducing individual climate footprint which in turn mitigates climate change. The Union of Concerned Scientists notes 17% of the average American's carbon footprint comes from heating and cooling our homes, and in addition, 15% comes from other energy-related use in the home. Besides, 80 metric tons of CO2 are released to build a typical house. Another big part of our carbon footprint is transportation which is about 28%. The good thing is these two big problems can be solved in one simple way: move into a city. City living can dramatically reduce car use. For example, in Beijing, we have more than ten subway lines that could take you anywhere you want with low cost and no traffic congestion. Many students and workers choose to take public transportation to commute. The large city also means smaller and more efficient housing. Smaller and more efficient housing could reduce our climate footprint by decreasing the energy we use in our homes such as lighting and heating and cooling the house. When our home is smaller, we need to reduce everything unnecessary because we don't have the space to store these stuff. Ken mentions another effective way to reduce individual climate footprint—cohousing which people share services and amenities with others in their community as they can sometimes share meals which are cooked in the community kitchen. However, this is not common in America because cohousing challenges the American individualism tradition. Once again, I believe we should view many problems related to climate change as cultural problems. I think this will help us better mitigate the climate crisis.
<br><hr>
I agree with you. Times are changing, so we need to change our ideas and behaviors. As Ken mentioned, in Thoreau's time, people advocated returning to the countryside, but now this concept will bring us a lot of harm. Because of yearning for rural life and aversion to urban life, many people have moved to the suburbs. Maybe they do live the ideal life, but they produce more carbon emissions that cause more harm to the environment. Judging from the current society, living in the city is indeed a good choice. It is undeniable that the dull and noisy life of the city does make some people uncomfortable. A good way is to increase the greening of the city, thereby improving people's mood. If the city has both convenience and many natural landscapes, I believe more people will choose to live in the city.

<br><hr>
I also grew up in a city myself, and I have lived in suburban area in Eastern Coast during my high school years, but I personally enjoy more of my life in cities. Living in a city is really convenient as you can get almost everything you need within 20 minutes walking distance. It might seem to be intolerant to live a life without car in the suburban area, but in contrast, living in a city without a car is not a difficult thing, as you can commute by subways or buses, which normally will transport you even faster comparing with taking a car. In fact, public transportation is not only more environmental friendly, it is also cheaper and can save you a lot of money than drive by yourself. 
<br><br>

I agree with you point of view that there should be nature things such as a roof garden in cities. In fact, a lot of cities have already put this idea into actions. For example visiting the garden hall in New York which was built up on a unused train track is an amazing experience.
<br><hr>
Agreed! It is important to not view industrialization and urbanization as a completely negative thing. Climate scientists and activists, it seems, often put down the shift from a simpler, more rural lifestyle to a busy, and bubbling city life. It connects more people, places, and ideas. It also shortens time and distance to and from work and social and leisure activities. 

<br><br>

I like that you mention the "positive influence that nature can create is essential to urban life." I find this to be even broader as I apply this statement to my whole life! I live in a 170 square foot dorm room and find it essential to have as many green indoor plants in the room as I can. It livens up the place, contributes to healthy air, and makes me smile when I care for them and watch them grow. 
<br><br>


My city, Costa Mesa, in the term of our 2018-2019 mayor, began implementing a new style of urban living. "Building up instead of out" was their intention, but instead led to the city's absurd increase in traffic. Their market was late baby boomers, noted to be called: "mobile, vigorous, and digitally connected."  A good idea initially, but everything comes with a cost.

<br><hr>
I agree with you on saying how there is almost a disconnect with how living in a city can affect your carbon footprint. I too once thought that cities did not really think about environmentalism and how their motto was about consumerism. Now I know that this is not the case. I had no idea that a fair amount of people in cities try to, as Ken put it, “bring nature to cities” so that they can have a small bit of green in their life. This is why I have never really wanted to live in a big city because I love nature. But if there are people who make these rooftop gardens and cafes, then maybe I was too quick to judge how much green you can find in a jungle of concrete and steel.

<br><hr>
As someone who also lives near San Francisco and has visited many times, I have always disliked the hustle and bustle of the big city. I have always thought of it to be too loud and busy for my liking. I also viewed it as environmentally detrimental due to the large amount of cars and smog that are associated with city life. However, after watching this lecture, I can see how cities can be actually helpful to the environment. Due to the close proximity, public transport and walking are much more accessible forms of transportation in the city. Unlike the suburbs and rural areas where everything is really spread out, everything is very close together in a city. Thus, housing is more condensed into smaller apartments that save space as well as limits the amount of space each person lives in. This encourages smaller living spaces that are good for the environment, unlike the huge houses many are accustomed to living in these days. 
<br><br>
 Despite the good living in cities can do for the environment, I find some problem with the idea that we should just start moving into cities. It isn’t exactly the most  realistic idea in my opinion. As you mentioned, there are many people who would have trouble transitioning into city life at first. Cities are expensive to live in. While living expenses are already expensive in California, cities are often a lot more expensive. I am not saying that everyone moving to the cities to help the environment is a bad idea, but I just do not know if it is completely possible for some people to do so. However, I do believe it is something that we should move towards and I am sure that overtime, it is something that can be achievable.
<br><hr>
I also thought that growing up in cities were gross, polluted, and not best suited for environmentally friendly concerns. I now see that this is wrong. The way that people live in cities is surprisingly (but now not so surprisingly) eco friendly. Because many people live in small apartments they reduce their carbon footprint through the various ways. Along with this, because city life is so crowded many people don’t have cars and choose to use public transport, which is so much better for the environment. I agree with you that city life is definitely hard juggling many different things, but it is also enticing to me living in a big city and doing my part to reduce c02 emissions. I also think that it may get overwhelming without the sense of nature in big cities, but if we are able to incorporate nature into these cities I think it will be a big win. Take Central Park, for example, many people use this as an escape from the hustle of the city and are able to take in nature while also living in a compacted place, but also reducing their carbon footprint. I think there are many things we can do to help reduce our co2 emissions, but it is interesting and relieving that moving to a smaller place in a big city can be a part of the journey.
<br><hr>
I think San Francisco is probably one of the cities with a lot of people in houses with a small average square foot. And that’s not because it’s full of environmentalists, it’s because of the price. Many big cities, especially in California, have crazy expensive houses and apartments. People don’t move to urban areas just because they like nature, they also do it because it’s much cheaper. The main problem with becoming an environmentalist is the cost. Vegan food is more expensive, and harder to find, and living in cities can really take a good chunk from your paycheck. That’s why many people live just outside of San Francisco and commute there for work. For many people that means they need a car because they can’t get there anywhere else. Yes you could bike, but it rains a lot in San Francisco and you could bus, but with the traffic, it would take you hours to get to work. If being a true environmentalist was cheaper, I’m sure there would be a lot more people that would do it. But, with the way the world is now, it’s impossible to expect everyone to be able to afford that lifestyle.
<br><hr>
I had just about the same outlook on cities as you did. I thought about the large population, crowded streets, consumerism, and also did not believe that people were environmentalists. Along with cutting our individual footprint with living in a city, I thought brining the rural and urban lifestyle together is a great way to pep up the city life. I do believe the transition is what is most difficult. I also find being away from nature and not having a connection with the natural world to be a problem. As you mentioned, many have brought nature to city and has created a better atmosphere to be in for those who live or spend most of their time in the city.
<br><hr>
I shared a view similar to yours in that the only thing I ever associated with cities was pollution, consumerism, and many many people. However, after Ken’s video I was shocked to learn that I had completely overlooked all the good that cities bring to the table. One of Ken’s main support points for people to move to cities was that the housing alone decreases one’s carbon footprint by a large portion. Additionally, the time people spend driving also decreases and many find it even more convenient to take local transportation, such as subways, instead. These changes have incredibly high impacts on the environment and quite positive ones at that! 
<br><br>


Sadly, I do not think that many people will actually make the switch to city living. Especially in America, where we have we have all grown up with the image of the “American Dream”. People are not going to willingly give up their white-picket fences in exchange for a much smaller and compact living situation. The current, general consensus is that “if I made all this money, I should be allowed to spend it on a big house to show my wealth”. While no one would say this aloud, this thought runs through many American minds and we are unlikely to convince them to switch to apartment-style living when they just “upgraded” to an actual house.

<br><hr>
I agree with the confusion you have between the pros and cons of city living and the perceived idea of what city living is actually like in regards to the climate crisis. I never really thought of city living to be a positive thing for the crisis as I also just thought of it as a place with too many people that all add to the problems of consumerism and environmental hazards. I never thought about the living arrangements and how shared places are common and better for the environment. Also, the means of transportation in city life are better as mass transit is needed in order to allow for all the people to get around in due time without the streets being backed up with cars from every person.
<br><br>
There definitely are cons to this way of living though for people who are not used to it. First of all, the stress of living in such close quarters with other people or having chaos follow you wherever you go can be too much for some people. City living is not very peaceful and there are always things going on around you. There are also fewer ways to getaway like what you said about nature. In the city, you are more constrained to being stuck in the hustle and not being able to head right down to the beach or mountains to escape the mayhem. I think that we should not have to switch to city life but we should adapt our personal lives with the positive aspects present in cities and use it as a role model for changing our lives into something better for society while keeping our needs in place as well.

<br><hr>
I totally agree with your sentiments here. When you lose your perspective and connection to nature, it can be very difficult to keep your choices in perspective. Especially if you have made the move to a city for environmental reasons, it would be difficult to then not have an ability to experience the nature you are trying to save. I think small rooftop gardens are awesome, but nothing can replace a real park or forest.
<br><br>
Personally I cannot ever see myself living in a large city. They are too chaotic and I would feel claustrophobic. Studies have actually found that people are on average more happy when they live in nature vs a large city. Large cities need to find new ways of introducing more parks to cities to make those who liv e in cities feel closer and more grounded to nature.
<br><hr>
I would agree that many big cities in general have a sort of disconnectedness with nature that makes it quite difficult for people to familiarize themselves with the natural world. I like to look at really cool examples of big cities like Singapore, that have built within their structures, living material and natural phenomena. For example the tree house apartment buildings that incorporate plant life into the infrastructure of the building, along with the city planners overall inclusion of plant life. I think it is possible for us to design our cities in a way that connects us with nature and creates an inclusive and inspiring environment for the inhabitants.
<br><hr>
I have always loved cities and have always dreamt of living in New York City at some point in my life. Through taking this class, I'm seeing more and more reasons to pursue this dream, as there are many environmental benefits as well. A place like NY would not require a car whatsoever, as everything is either walkable or a subway away. Unfortunately, many large cities don't boast the same highly developed public transit system. This means that other big cities like LA may require more car use, which not only is bad for the environment, but also causes unwanted traffic. I don't think one big city is just like the rest, though there are similarities, I'd say they're all quite different, and thus have varying effects on the climate crisis. To us NYC for example again, they have Central Park. Without this park I believe the city would be a lot less livable, so the point you're making is very accurate that nature is needed in life. One can't simply live in a world of concrete and be fine with it. For mental health as well as many other benefits, nature is necessary. 
<br><br>
What you said about your mom having the rooftop garden near her sounds like a nice escape from her office job. I'm from Seattle, another big city which is rapidly growing, and my mom also works in an office all day. She takes the bus home everyday, for no other reason than that she simply enjoys it, and I know she always makes a point to leave enough time so she can get a good walk in before getting on the bus. This isn't the same thing as having a park or rooftop garden, but Seattle has nature pretty much everywhere. It sits on the water and there's trees galore. To be fair, we don't live downtown, and I think that would definitely be a different experience, as we live in a neighborhood, with parks within walking distance, but there are also parks downtown, it's just a different lifestyle. It's definitely not for everyone, and I do believe nature is a requirement when living in a small space in a big city, but if it's helping the environment, I would definitely make the move.
<br><hr>
I also grew up outside of San Francisco, on Mt. Tamalpais. I feel like the amazing nature around our house is partially what led everyone in my family to care so deeply about the environment, and so its hard conceptually to think about city life as environmental progress, but it does make a lot of sense. My family also goes up to Northern California every summer, to a tiny town in Humboldt country. The people who live here are the ones who took the whole "back to nature" movement to the extreme. Up until recently, I thought they lived the most sustainable lives -- growing their own food, making their own furniture, showering in the river... stuff like that. Then I started to think about the resources these people needed to get here -- a lot of money, support, and CO2 emissions surely went into all of these homestead lifestyles. Not everyone has nor should have the resources to build their own huge house out in a beautiful natural landscape. 
<br><br>

I think it is crucial we don't define this kind of life as environmentally conscious. Just because someone is in nature, eating naturally, buying natural products, doesn't mean they are helping the planet. This is because not everyone can do that. If they did, we would simply take up too much space and overrun all the forests and rivers and natural landscapes. Caring about the planet means so much more than caring about your own access to nature. It means thinking about human equality and collective sustainable living and EVERYONE'S ACCESS. This is why making cities greener is so much smarter than running away from them.

<br><hr>
I totally agree with what you said. As someone who used to live in a very crowded neighborhood, I have dreamed to live in a big house since I was little. As someone who used to live in a very crowded neighborhood, I've been dreaming of living in a big house since I was a child. However, the concept of the climate crisis is introduced in this course really change my opinion about housing. Living in a small house and being a minimalist can help us reduce our carbon footprint, which would be beneficial to mitigate the climate crisis.
<br><hr>
·      I really appreciate your comment. I used to have the same thought of city as you. I live in big city for around 19 years, so in my mind city is full of traffic jams, chaos, and crime. In this way, city in my opinion is the chief culprit of climate crisis. However, in the lecture, it is surprised to know that the structure of city would be actually efficient for our environment. For example, it would be more convenient to use public transportation and the elements of the city would be tied closely instead of spreading everywhere. Moreover, the size of apartment in the city save more spaces due to its limited place and high price. Also, I agree with what you said about the “peaceful area.” From my own experience, those kinds of area provide me places to relax myself instead of wasting time to travel somewhere which can also decorate our environment.
<br><hr>
I too thought that cities would be more hurtful to the environment. I mean with constant traffic, people rummaging through the streets, and the increasing technology that seems to be increasingly present, it feels like cities would be the prime emitter for CO2. After watching this lecture though, it seems so obvious. How because they are so busy and packed that means people are confined to live in smaller places, with less things, and (because the cost of living in cities is much higher) that usually results in a smaller presence of families. While it takes us out of nature - away from the freshness that we are capable of experiencing, it is simultaneously helping us - to some degree - preserve that exact nature.
<br><hr>
I agree that the transition will be very hard for many people. The chaos that you mentioned may be even too much for many to handle, and thus due to emotional/psychological trauma, living a suburban or rural lifestyle may be the best option for those who suffer from anxiety/mental health problems. Also, it is worth mentioning that housing within cities is not cheap, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area. A vast majority of the people that actually live in the city are "techies", or those making tons of money from high tech businesses in Silicon Valley, which helps support their ability to afford their outrageously expensive small one bedroom apartment. And for those apartments that can be afforded, they are usually extremely run down and located in sketchy/unsafe neighborhoods. If you are someone who has grown up in suburbia all your life and then transition to a cramped, dirty apartment with 5 other strangers, I'm not sure you would very happy with your current predicament. If we can invest more into building and subsidizing urban housing, then these issues can be vastly alleviated, but in the meantime, such a drastic lifestyle change is, I'm afraid, too much for most people.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with you here. I never realized that nature and cities could be combined into one. I suppose the idea that nature and cities must be complete opposites was so ingrained in my brain, I could imagine no other way. But it makes so much sense that they can be combined. Indeed, my favorite part of my dorm (which as anyone who has lived in dorms knows, are stuffy and chaotic, much like city life) is my little succulent. Even though it is tiny, it really brings s much light and life into the room. It is no wonder that cities can do the same. I love the idea of a roof-top garden. Being able to enjoy nature easily, interact with nature by gardening, and reducing the carbon footprint of your food by growing your own fruits and vegetables are a win-win-in scenario. I think cities should definitely incorporate rooftop gardens or even orchards onto every single building, I think they can go even farther. Cities should incorporate more parks and designated natural cities within them. Even something as simple as planting a TON more trees along the sidewalks and roads can make a huge difference. 
<br><br>
I'm so glad that your mom is able to have the roof-top garden getaway from lunch when she needs a break from the city. And while I agree with you that cities are often too chaotic to be pleasant to live in, I think that incorporating more nature into the city can make them feel more calm and serene, inviting more people to live in the cities who were otherwise offset by the chaos.

<br><hr>
After reading your comment, I strongly agree with everything you said. This week's video can definitely change ones perspective on cities as you learn that they can actually have benefits towards helping the environment and reducing our personal carbon footprint. Living in the suburbs or in a rural area can significantly increase your carbon footprint because you most likely will have to drive miles just for a basic grocery store. Compared to the city, there are stores at almost every corner that are accessible walking or driving less than a mile. 
<br><br>

As you said though, the transition can be challenging for people who aren't accustomed to this lifestyle. Many people don't have the patience of dealing with traffic or just heavy loads of people and lines which can cause social conflict.

<br><hr>


I agree with your comment! The transition from the suburbs or rural areas to urban areas such as cities might be indeed a difficult transition for many people. As you mention, big cities are often seen as an area of mayhem as there is a lot of traffic, a lot of people, a lot of buildings and very few green areas. Many people do not realize that they need nature. Nature provides a peaceful place from all the chaos in the city. I personally would not mind living in a reduced space in the city as I will be reducing my carbon footprint. I would not mind sharing a space with other people in my community as this creates relationships. However, I think I am not fit to live in a city as I often like to explore the wilderness and be in sync with nature. I cannot be forced to live somewhere where I feel unhappy, and if I feel unhappy then I will not be able to help the environment. 
<br><br>
I believe cities should become green metropolis as Ken commented. A city where nature and humans live as one. We need more green areas in our cities, more parks, more rooftop gardens, greener! If we achieve a greener city, then I might consider move there, yet I still feel like crowded areas as cities are not my thing. Maybe as I grow older, I will change the way I think as I still need to grow as a person. Therefore, I am not completely throwing the idea of migrating to a big city in the future. Lastly, I agree with everything Ken talked about to reduce our carbon footprint. This time he tackled the housing issue that we face as society. Ken does a great job connecting previous videos and ideas to new ones. By doing so, he reminds us of what we need to do, what we can STILL do, and what we can still achieve if we work together as a community. Collective action and personal action need to have as primarily goal to save the Earth. To achieve a greener economy. To achieve a healthier present and future for our children.


<br><hr>

I also thought that city living was a less environmentally friendly way to live because cities are so disconnected from nature and are the symbols of urbanism. However, it makes sense seeing from a different perspective how city living is actually much better for the environment than buying a large home in the suburbs. When you condense a lot of people in a smaller space, the resources you need to survive aren’t going to be as difficult to obtain. Food and other necessities are often reachable by walking distance if you live in the heart of any medium-sized cities, as grocery stores are distributed more frequently to provide for a greater density of people; in contrast, people who live in suburban or rural areas usually have to drive to their nearest grocery store, which could be anything between five and thirty minutes away from where they live. The difference in carbon footprints of these lifestyles in obtaining basic necessities alone is already substantial. People who live in cities are also more likely to take public transportation to places that are too far of a walking distance, such as commuting to work. This is another practice that is environmentally-friendly because the carbon emissions per person is much lower in people who use public transit versus people who drive themselves.
<br><br>
Size of housing also plays an important role, because less resources are needed to maintain apartments in a city as opposed to two story homes in the suburbs. The only thing I think most cities in the U.S. needs to do better is incorporate more parks and green spaces into public areas.
<br><hr>
This week's lecture video has definitely helped me view larger cities with a new perspective. When I think of cities, such as Manhattan, I think of chaos, littering, overpopulation and many industrial and taxi transportation. But, Ken has changed this mindset by stating that a transportation and housing solution would be to move to a city living community which can dramatically lessen car use and generally live in more smaller and efficient houses. Due to the city's population, it makes bicycles use a more practical and efficient way to travel which can help the climate in the long one. One main concern would be safety, I think their needs to be more funding in order to create more bike pathways that can safely lead an individual to their destination without being in the way of pedestrians and the danger of vehicles. It is crazy to hear how housing has become double the size. It is disgusting how bigger is known as better if you can afford it; this all goes back to the false perception of the “American Dream” and people trying to own the most expensive and latest fashionable clothes. Ken stated that traditional Japanese homes are 1/10th the size of American homes; otherwise measured as 400 ft and hold the occupancy of a family of 4. This is a prime example that Americans have the potential to live a minimalist lifestyle as American families are now considerably smaller. American families truly do need a house that is 3,000 or more square ft when 32% of American climate footprint is coming from these  homes: 17% comes from heating and 15% come from lighting and housing - additionally 10% came from eating. 
<br><br>
I agree, City living is the main point to where we need to personally direct our attention. It is crazy to me that 80 metric tons is released from housing when making them but houses do generally last longer than an automobile's  11 years of life. Also, I COMPLETELY agree that one main concern I would have is being so disconnected to nature and the beauty of the planet which would lead to people becoming overwhelmed and full of craziness. I believe there should be an even distribution of city living and including nature into our towns, such as community gardens.

<br><hr>

I agree with you! There is no specific guide to living green; one can lead a significantly more sustainable life in a bustling city than Walden Pond.
<br><br>

When thinking of a city like New York City, sustainability doesn't typically come to mind. In fact, I think the opposite. I'm disgusted by the amount of cars, the dense population, and automatically assume it isn't environmentally friendly. 
<br><br>

When I think of a large house in the prairie, I automatically assume it's eco-friendly and good for the environment. 
<br><br>

These stereotypes are not true, and can become a dangerous view. There are several ways one can live bette tin a large city. 
<br><br>

One can live closer to work, eliminating a long commute from the suburbs to the city and back everyday. Since one lives closer to work and everything else, a car isn't necessary travel. Places like NYC have popular public transit systems which are more popular than driving. In a city, more people tend to live in less space, maximizing living resources. 
<br><br>

Suburbia, despite seeming "closer to the environment", is actually more detrimental. Because it encourages longer commutes, the production of more automobiles, and the use of more resources for their houses. 
<br><br>

Cities can even be "green" in the literal sense. Cities can designate specific areas for conservation and greenery, such as Central Park in NYC. Rooftop and community gardens can encourage local food sources.
<br><hr>
I completely understand what you mean but I used to live in downtown Copenhagen and I never had problem getting close to nature. Living in a city doesn't have to be craziness, it just depends on how the city is set up. There are parks and places to relax on nearly every other block in Copenhagen. I lived in the suburbs my whole life so i thought moving to the center of a city would be a hard transition but it really wasn't. I know Copenhagen is not nearly as big as LA or San Francisco but it does prove that city living can be calm, relaxing, and environmentally friendly.
<br><hr>
I have the same feeling as you do! I was impressed when Ken talked about that one way to reduce carbon footprints is to limit housing few weeks ago. Before I took this class, I never relate this aspect to climate changes. After reading and watching so many videos throughout this quarter, I feel educated. Grown up in a big city, I got used to city life already, and in other word, city life is already my life. When I first came to UCSB, I was not very comfortable with the life here. I love the ocean, the weather and the people here, but I just felt inconvenient. In my hometown, I could just step out of my apartment and walk into a restaurant in less than 5 minute, but here, I have to drive. However, after living in SB for so long, I am in love with the suburban life. Everything is just some rustic and simple, and I am more closed to nature. I barely see clear blue sky in my hometown, but I could appreciate the incredible sunset and clear sky every day. It is such a bless. And after watching the video, I think this way I am living is also good for our environment. Not living in a city means that I do not have to rely on transportation that much, and thus, the individual carbon footprint can be reduced. I am kind of proud.
<br><hr>
I've never lived in the city, and up until recently felt no urge to ever experience it. Like you mentioned, I thought that I would never be able to get away from all of the craziness and be able to feel close to any sort of nature. My biggest qualm has always been how the air in big cities just isn't as fresh as it is when living in a more rural setting. However, the benefits that come with living in a big city, especially ones like Manhattan or San Francisco, far outweigh the cons. Even the cons are easy to maneuver around. For example, your mother finding peace in a rooftop garden and cafe. My biggest concern for myself and others who plan to live in cities right out of college, is the already very high and rising cost of living. Living in either of the cities I mentioned previously is insanely expensive. It's much more manageable for someone older with a fully developed career, but not necessarily fresh out of college students with lots of debt starting at the bottom of corporate ladders. I hope micro apartments help relieve this financial burden, but I fear that their trendiness will cause a rise in prices. Living small should be beneficial not only for personal carbon footprints, but financially as well. You're paying for less square footage, less heating, electricity, etc. All household costs are brought to a minimum. I've also noticed a side benefit that I love which is that when you live small, you don't lose any of your possessions (because there's no place for them to disappear). Also, mess is so much more manageable. Cleaning becomes a 30 minute task instead of something that takes half the day for a suburban home.
<br><hr>
I, as well, grew up just outside a big city (Los Angeles) and have always seen it as a nasty, unsanitary, and crowded place. Hours of traffic, thousands of homeless people, and almost no nature surrounding it doesn’t seem like an ideal place to live. I remember being in a car driving around Los Angeles and asking myself why so many people want to visit here. Yet, it is where 4 million people choose to live, even with extremely overpriced houses. I was also shocked to find out that city living can be impactful in reducing climate footprint. I think a lot about how many people at UCSB currently are living in very small, cramped dorms. Although it may not be preferred, this amount of space is all someone needs to live. Cities are definitely not ideal for most people, as you have noted many of the negatives of being in a city. I feel that the reasons you stated could be a representation of why so many Californians are moving to places outside of the city. The housing crisis is just going to get worse and worse, and eventually more people will want to move into more rural eras because it is so much cheaper. 
<br><br>

The example of you mom on the rooftop reminds me of UCSB and how there is the beach right outside our campus where we can go and clear our mind or watch the sunsets. I think Los Angeles should invest more in things like gardens or parks to make Los Angeles have more nature, similar to how New York has a central park. However, it is hard to get away from the noises and pollution of the city. It is never completely quiet in my house. There’s always the humming of electricity or motorcycles making noise. It makes me wonder if people will move out of cities more. It makes me think about my cousins who live about 30 mins outside of the nearest town. However, the amount of carbon emissions they have from driving must be far greater than those in the city, simply because all of the things necessary are in a 5 mile radius. This is interesting because I have always thought that they were saving the environment by not living in the city.
<br><hr>
I definitely agree with the idea that cities seemed to be worse than living outside of them regarding someone's carbon footprint. It makes sense to me now as I reflect on where I live. I live in an area that although I can walk to nearby places, such as the mall, park, and food places, outside of that I have to drive. If I want to hang out with my friends, one of us has to drive in order to go find somewhere to hang out or go to one another's house. Even though there are other transportation methods, such as the bus, taking a car is the most convenient thing in my area. This is mainly due to the bus not being efficient and bike lanes not being accessible. However, this is different to if I had lived in a city where it was more densely populated. Public transportations seems to be more accessible and efficient and one can easily just walk to places. Whenever I go visit Downtown Los Angeles, we tend to just park our car and walk everywhere because everything is within walking distance. Obviously this can vary based on what you want to do or live, but personally it's much easier than back at home where I have to drive everywhere. Besides that, I do agree with you that it could create an issue in terms of not forming a close connection to nature. However, your solution of implementing rooftop gardens, etc. seems to be a good way to fix that.

<br><hr>
That is just so true and somewhat ironic. Living close to nature seems attractive but it increases one’s carbon footprint drastically because a car is necessary to go around. Personally, I prefer the civilized lifestyle in cities over living close to nature. Before college, I lived in NYC where I found to be the most amazing place I have ever been to. There are just so many fun events going on in the city. The shows, parties, and sports never ceased to interest me. On the other hand, I found nature to be quiet and calming. Not to be mean, I think people should live away from nature because we are just not part of the animal world. Why are we going to take places from wildlife when we have a way to live together and not disturb them? It must be annoying for them to see their old habitat becomes an apartment zone.
<br><hr>
I also had a different view of cities after watching this video. Like you, I grew up very close to a large, bustling city---Los Angeles. Because I grew up in such a fast-paced environment packed with people and buildings, I thought it was the way of life until I enrolled in this class. I agree with you and find it interesting that you believe cities destroy the idea of being close to nature. I always found it fascinating when people, who come from rural areas, mention that they have an entire forest as their backyard. Since I grew up in an urban environment, my "backyard" was a small strip of grass and a brick wall. I really liked this lecture video because it gave cities a better rep.

<br><hr>
I really enjoy your comment as it gives insight into city life.  I came from a small farming town in the Central Valley and have never experienced city life.  I have been San Francisco many times, but it is a totally different experience when that is your home.  The idea that cities are represented as this industrial capital, destroyers of nature and enemies for the climate change movement.  The opposite is true in fact.  As Ken states the most environmentally efficient way to live is within a city as the destinations that you need to travel are much closer with many more means of public transport.  Also, the space that you live in the city is normally much less than in small-town or the suburbs, not by choice, but because the price per square foot is much higher so most people have no choice but to reduce their carbon emissions.  The statistic that Ken states that 55% of all people on the planet live in cities and it is on an upward trend meaning that we are headed in the right direction.
   <br><br>
                         I feel like I would feel the same as your mom if I lived in the city.  I'm used to having orchards and nature to walk in and destress if I need it, but in cities, those types of spots aren't as frequent.  I can definitely tell when comparing in side by side with living in the city that suburban homes and small-town living emit much more carbon into the environment.  My town is filled with people that commute to San Francisco which is an hour and a half drive one way just they don't have to pay the insane prices for a place in the city.  It makes sense from a money perspective but not for the environment as they drive their Ram Trucks 5 days a week to work and back.  Not to mention houses here are just bigger for no reason, for example, my house has two guest bedrooms  TWO!! both of them never get used and are a waste of heating and cooling which contributes 17% of Americans' emissions.  Cities seem like the way to go for the future and I have always wanted the experience so it looks like I'm going to be a city boy.
<br><hr>
I used to go to Japan every summer to visit my relatives and stayed at their (in American people’s terms) tiny apartment. To give one example of an aspect of the apartment, the kitchen was the smallest room in the house (not including the toilet room, more compact and smaller than the size of a toilet stall at UCSB). The kitchen had a sink, chopping space enough for one chopping board and a plate placed above it, and two stove tops vertically aligned. The entire kitchen had probably enough room for 2 people to stand (not walk around, but stand), and we were able to make complete and amazing meals for a family of 4-5. 
<br><br>

One time I visited Paris, I walked around the city the entire day, not once taking public transportation like the metro or bus, and to my surprise, found parts of Paris that were so quiet that it truly, almost felt like I wasn’t even in Paris. 
<br><br>

I share these anecdotes to show that although we think of hectic, constant mayhem when we think of “cities,” there are still beautiful, quiet, and serene parts of cities. People are also living perfectly comfortable lifestyles in smaller spaces. There is definitely a cultural factor when it comes to the lifestyle in Japan (from my personal experience, Japanese people tend to be smaller and slimmer than Americans, more conscientious of their surroundings and space, and have you seen the recycling laws in Japan?! GOOGLE IT. Your neighbors literally get mad at you if you put different plastic products in the wrong designated pile and there are different days for different types of recyclable products), but we can learn from it! 
<br><br>

There will be people unwilling to challenge themselves to transition to a city living lifestyle, but for people like us students inspired by Ken’s class, I think we should challenge ourselves to live in ways that may have seemed uncomfortable by remembering that we made the change as a form of environmental activism.
<br><hr>
I agree with you that a common perception of cities, in environmental terms, has negative connotations associated with congestion, capitalism and consumerism. However, as much of this course's material has revealed, cities also present a huge opportunity to reduce our carbon footprint by living in ways that foster a sense of community and environmental awareness and appreciation. I think there are so many creative and exciting ways that we can accomplish this while creating a better society for everyone. I also agree that we need to start fostering a great connection to nature. We are so used to living busy lives that some of us rarely take the time to stop and smell the flowers, so to speak. As someone that has lived in Santa Barbara for six years, living about 10 minutes away from the beach, I have only recently started taking advantage of that by going to the beach on a weekly basis. In larger cities, I think having designated green spaces could help people make the connection with nature.
<br><hr>
    I agree that outlets for nature in cities is really important to get away from the mayhem of them. I grew up in a suburb all of my life close to the beach, which I honestly loved. The house I grew up in may be bigger than necessary and it could be useful to cut down on housing size and simplify. Cities have always felt very claustrophobic to me and I usually do not really enjoy them - anytime I travel to them I usually find myself with a deep desire to go somewhere in nature. I could not really see myself living in a city. This video somewhat changed my mind about that - I really like the idea of coexisting with nature and the city - bringing nature to the urban and combining these two seemingly polar opposites. If there was a city that was truly green - plants and food growing every block I saw and much more beautiful greenery than concrete buildings, I would feel much more at home and able to live in a city, albeit I would still likely feel cramped. 
<br><br>


As far as micro-housing and community housing goes, I believe they are good options. It is really unnecessary to have a big house. I want to have a simple life, and therefore, a simple house. With a tinier house, I would want to be outside more which I think is awesome.

<br><hr>

Especially in the Bay Area and suburbs everywhere, there is not real work for many, and jobs are in the main cities. Going back to the Bay, my dad works in Sunnyvale, which is near San Jose, but we live 30 miles away in the suburb Pleasanton. I can't even describe some of the traffic he has to sit in, he even jokes and calls one of the freeways (the 237) the parking lot, and that the old man in his walker just flipped him off while the old man passed my dad on his nightly walk. He leaves before the sun comes up and sometimes won't get home until past 9, having spent hours in traffic. If, instead my parents lived closer to where he works, perhaps in the city, that commute could be so much easier, and not to mention so much better for the environment. Now this is just one case, imagine if everyone doing that commute did the same, and populated up the San Jose area more, they could take a bus, or train to work, leave and be home at decent times, overall be happier. Living in cities may not be for everyone, but it makes sense not only for our mental health, but our planet.

<br><hr>
I don’t know about everyone else, but I think cities are super fun. When I go on vacations, they always revolve around the biggest, most popular places. So many thing to explore in a big city, like Chicago, New York, LA, etc. The culture is more patriotic, big events like festivals, parades, and holidays, and impressive architecture. Busy is good and they are always hustling and bustling. So much potential and opportunities are held inside every city, and I would love to work in one after college. Therefore, if other people share my ideology, it shouldn't be hard to mobilize more Americans to join the metropolitan wonderlands. 
<br><br>


Unique innovations like rooftop gardens, backyard chicken coops, and vertical farms are intriguing to me. Green metropolises are not counter-intuitive, as many people love parks and greenery to look at and walk through. All things environmental are becoming more trendy in cities, probably because everyone living there is already on board with lowering their carbon footprint. 

<br><br>


Its shocking to me how other cultures like Japan, find co-communities and public transportation so normal and imbedded in their lives.  After visiting this winter break, I become a believer that one day America can change their ways.
<br><hr>
I completely agree!  I grew up in a very small town on the coast of SLO and have rarely set foot in a big city, the most time I have spent has been in big cities in Brasil when I visit my family.  Having grown up with the ocean in front of me and sprawling hills on all sides, big cities have always seemed super hectic and not very appealing.  If I would ever move to a big city, I think that the transition, as you said, would be super hard and I don't know if I would ever be ok with losing the closeness to nature.  However, I think that some of the things Ken discussed could make the transition a lot easier for other people.  I really like the idea of rooftop gardens and goats and other livestock intermingling with everyday life.  I think that there needs to be more parks and open spaces within cities to break up the craziness and give people somewhere to go and relax and take a break from the bustling city to enjoy the peacefulness of nature.
<br><hr>
This week’s lecture video also gave me a new perspective on living in the cities. Similar to you, I was born and raised in Los Angeles, one of the largest cities in America, even bigger than the entirety of San Francisco. Kenneth Hiltner taught me that living in the city can be extremely impactful in reducing someone’s individual carbon footprint. I did not realize that living in the city can actually be beneficial to the environment, considering all the factories and the insane amount of cars in Los Angeles. It makes sense to me now that there is mass public transit everywhere and the houses are definitely smaller than those in more rural areas. Looking at Los Angeles, there are tons of high rise apartment complexes, meaning since the living space is significantly smaller, there is less consumption of natural resources and fewer carbon emissions in each household. I agree with you that it might be hard for someone from the country to move into the city, everything is a lot more crowded and the population is a lot more dense.
<br><br>

 I actually want to live in the city when I am older, and I hope to see more regreening of urban places in the future. I think reintroducing nature into cities is such a great idea. In the lecture video, Hiltner tells us that people who live in cities with a lot of nature are more happy than those who don’t. I visited San Francisco for the first time a week ago. Before visiting, I was expecting to see almost no green because I believed that the city was just a lot of buildings and homes. I was surprised that there was so much nature integrated in the city. Whoever planned the landscape out for San Francisco utilized what little space the city had greatly. I think San Francisco is a perfect example that nature can be a part of the city.

I really liked your comment and completely agree with your perspective on cities. When first hearing that city life could actually reduce carbon emissions quite shocked me because like you, I thought those in the city were consuming hungry and had no environmental consciousness. When I think of a place such as New York I think of the high-end fashion industries and the constant consumerism but never about how much they save my walking as a way of transportation and the subway being the most used transportation. Additionally, the small tiny apartments reduce one's lifetime carbon emissions so much more than one who lives in a big house. Not only does a bigger house create more emissions just building it, but it also must be filled with much more furniture and products. Moreover, regarding your perspective of living in the city, I completely agree that the city can disconnect you with nature, therefore you may not think about the environment as much since you are not surrounded by it. This is something that one must consider when they are making lifestyle changes and maybe compromise living a little further from the city but still have a small house and consume less than the average person.

I find your point very interesting. As I am completely opposite from you. I come from a very small town in Southern California that has a population of about 20,000 people. It's an agricultural community so our town is surrounded with what seems like endless acreage of fields. Consisting of a variety of crops. My county is one of California's top 5 producers for certain crops, home to the only cheese processing plant that produces Swiss and Muenster cheeses, with more beekeepers per capita than any other county in the nation, three dairies, 2/3 of the nations winter months vegetables, and so much more. In 2006 my county produced enough lettuce to make salads for 2.3 billion people. While of course all of this takes an immense amount of water, we also provide habitat to hundreds of thousands of birds, half of the birds that exist today have been spotted in and around my hometown. WIth all of this being said no one knows my town exists. It's a small town surrounded by other small towns with a strange mindset. Since we live basically in the middle of no where you would think everyone lives simple lifestyles but it is quite the contrary. You will always see the newest and nicest suburbans and trucks and single family homes of well over 2,000 square feet as a standard of living because we have the room for it. No one has ever heard of the below sea level community rich with nature and wildlife. My point is people have a lot of notions about big cities, small towns, etc. But, you never know what something is truly like until you are there.
<br><hr>
I grew up in the desert, pretty much in the middle of nowhere, and for most of my life I was under the seemingly common misconception that cities are less green than small towns. When my family would take trips to bigger cities, such as San Diego where my sister went to college, I was always in awe of the city but thought living there must be a nightmare in terms of emissions. It feels as though in the city there are always lights on somewhere, masses of traffic, and constant use of fossil fuels. As I made these assumptions I was sitting in the backseat of my family’s car. I did not think about how in that very moment I was in a machine that produces ridiculous amounts of CO2. A huge con of small town living, which is something that Ken has so often talked about, is the need to drive to do just about anything. While our town has everything that we need to live a relatively content life, sometimes we will make the hour long drive to the more populated and wealthy city because everything they have is of, simply put, better quality. We have a hospital, but at the time of my birth, there was no maternity ward so my parents drove an hour to get to a hospital that could deliver me as my mom went into early labor. While this is an example of a need, we have also travelled for things we want rather than need much more frequently than we can justify. All throughout high school my town’s lack of a club soccer team led me and a few other teammates to drive an hour to practice and compete nearly three times a week. If we were living in a city then these drives would be unnecessary, and our emissions would likely be much lower. Mass transit, as well as the ability to walk or bike to your destination is much more possible for those who live in closely packed cities than in more spread out towns with few resources.

It would be hard for me to give up nature completely as I have spent most of my life right next to a national park, so it made me feel hopeful when you mentioned the rooftop garden that your mom has next to her work in the city. I feel as though you touched on some really important aspects of what pushes people to live in the suburbs rather than in cities, such as the overwhelming commotion and lack of nature. While it might be tough for people to transition into city living we can only hope that we are able to keep improving on ideas to make city living more sustainable and more inviting. As Ken mentioned, much of the land we have is already covered by buildings, so it is our job to be innovative when it comes to finding places to put gardens. Rooftops are a great start, and as seen in the film “Tomorrow” we could also plant small gardens in unexpected places such as in front of police stations or in parking lots. Not only are rooftop gardens great as an escape from the stress of living or working in a busy city, they are also a great option for growing your own food. Transforming small places into gardens wherever possible is a great idea for cities and suburbs because any greenery that we can introduce in a time of such rampant deforestation is incredibly welcome.

Agree. This video completely shifted my understanding of living in cities. I always regard cities as the place of consumerism and chaos. I never imagine them the places of being environmental-friendly, because I always see them as economic drivers, with tons of carbon dioxide being emitted everyday. But this video and your comment reminded me of my personal experience to Hangzhou which is a city developing recently. I saw the communities there. It was a whole apartment with multiple,  separate houses for different people. I was having an internship and that community became my living place during my working. The room was simple, small, but fit me exactly well. It has everything, and every space is being functional. Living in the room makes me feel so comfortable and it's just such an amazing idea to build up houses like that. Because of many people live in the community, the relationship between each other is so close. People share food, watch movies together. Even though people are totally strangers with each other, coming from different places, doing different jobs, they ultimately become a family under the community's atmosphere.
<br><br>
That experience reminds me that even tough we are living in big cities, we can still do good to the environment. City can be more than economic growths, crowded people, it can be close, friendly, and green.

<br><hr>
I also think that we need to reconsider cities in terms of environmental impacts. As I learned from Climate Crisis 101, there are many ways we could construct infrastructures inside the cities in order to reduce environmental impacts, some include micro-apartment and rooftop gardens. I have been to downtown LA and have seen how compact the buildings are (also a lot of cars) it gives me a sense of choking. However, I found many places with rooftop gardens and mini gardens inside the city. Mini gardens are often found near residential areas, while rooftop gardens were built on the rooftop of a business building, which is really nice as it gives the workers a place to relax. I also learned that moving into rural or suburban areas is not a good idea because it might bring pollution to the place where it is originally not contaminated.
<br><hr>
This comment caught my eye because I actually live and grew up in downtown San Francisco. I've met people who have never been to San Francisco and ask me questions about what it's like growing up in a major city with, like you mentioned, "bustling people, consumerism, and chaos, with no sense of environmentalism whatsoever." And while this idea of a city is not completely wrong, because in major cities, the day never truly ends because cities never sleep. Lights are always on no matter where you are and there will always be a car on the road despite the hour. Consumerism is a huge thing in major cities, after all, major malls are incredibly close, there's always something to do, and tourism is huge. But like Ken mentions, living in a city isn't actually all that bad in relation to the climate crisis. One of the reasons mentioned in public transportation. I took public transportation my entire life, whether it was to and from school or to see friends. The bus system could take me anywhere in San Francisco. And if not busses, thing were extremely close and within walking distance. Growing up in downtown California, I could walk to the heart of downtown shopping within a few blocks. Like you mentioned, the transition to living in a city can be very jarring, because honestly, living in downtown meant loud honking or yelling in the middle of night when I'd be sleeping, or protests happening a few blocks away on weekends, and more. But it is all doable and I wouldn't trade it for somewhere else. 

<br><br>

I like that you mentioned cities seemingly have no connection to nature. This is very true but in my experience with San Francisco, we have Golden Gate Park and multiple botanical gardens throughout the city. These places are amazing outlets that allow people who live in cities to enjoy nature without it being too far. I think living in a city doesn't mean you have to give up a connection to nature and I like that you used your mom as an example with her garden!
<br><hr>
I really agree with your opinion as I was also inspired by this video of Ken as it also refreshes my impression about cities. I also like your example about rooftop garden, since this is my first time that I heard about it and I think it is a very effective and creative solution to the hubbub of large cities. Furthermore, I also like Ken’s notion of co-housing, which, as Ken mentions, challenges the individualistic tradition of having a kitchen, a bathroom, and a living room. Members of a community cook together in a community kitchen and share meals several times a week. This is very different from what I have experienced so far as I grew up in Beijing and almost all houses there are in the traditional individual structure. Nevertheless, I think this is a very creative and environmental-friendly way of housing that also helps to build a better and more harmonious community relationship. 
 <br><br>

I also think Kens notion of living in the cities is more sustainable very interesting. As Ken explained, this might seem counterintuitive, but this is actually true in many ways. As public transportation, food distribution, and management of other resources can be more efficient, living in a city can save a lot of energy and avoid a lot of pollution. Ken’s notion also reminds to think about different environmental advocacies in a clear-minded and reasonable way. Previously, while we were learning how Thoreau promotes a simplistic lifestyle, I thought that what he’s pursuing is probably a sort of simple, rural, and primitive way of life, but it turns out that “simple” may not be understood this way. By learning Ken’s lecture, I think I understand that “simple” should be understood in a flexible manner as it can refer to probably any action that reduces our carbon footprint and life messiness, such as reasonable minimalism including buying stuff of good quality rather than a large quantity of them, living in a small house, or finding internal peace rather than external richness. Ken interprets environmental problems in a cultural way, and this really not only encourages me to think about environmental problems in a different way but also to reflect on my lifestyle and the way to make my life more meaningful, which I think are closely interconnected in many ways. As I am double majoring in Environmental Studies and Economics, this class builds a very interesting connection between the areas that I’m interested in – economics that studies how to let people have a better life and environmental studies that investigates how to preserve the environment and their intersection about human’s relationship to the environment or nature.
<br><hr>
I always hold the same idea that i always considered the city to be crowded, chaos and consumerism. I was born in one of the largest cities in my home country and grow up in city. Almost all of my friends expect for a larger house with larger space in suburbs. And i am not exception. So, most of the families in city will move to the countryside or suburbs to spend their holiday. Though, i also love living in city because of it's convenience. The massive transportation systems can take me to anywhere in city which provide a great benefit for the person who doesn't own car like me. The crowded building largely cut the distance we have to travel when we need to get to other destination. And i love bustling  atmosphere. And there are many other things in city that attract me. But i never know that these strengths would help save our planet and improve environment by cutting carbon emission.  Like the public transportation, the most common way i used to get around,  is one of the most appealing way to cut co2 emission. And i am surprise that i always live in a  relatively environmental-friendly lifestyle even when i leave my  home country and get into campus living in dorm. One of the thought of me got changed is the willingness for a larger house. After taking this course especially watching this lecture, i am more certain about i will only buy a house in city which is just right for me and my family in the future as extra space is unnecessary. In this case, why not take action to help with the climate change.
<br><hr>
I had the same idea of a city as you. When I first heard Ken say that cities are actually beneficial to the fight against the climate crisis, I honestly thought I had heard wrong. Cities are usually very busy, cars everywhere and litter covering the streets and sidewalks. I could not believe that it was actually a good thing to live in a city. My family used to live in the city I am from (although it is not as big as SF) until we moved to the outskirts when I was in middle school. I thought it was so much better, since it was closer to nature, no light pollution so that we could see the stars, and quieter now that we weren’t a couple streets down from the hospital. After he explained why it would be so beneficial, it made a lot of sense. It is easier to travel by public transport, walking, or biking when living in a city. It would take me 15-20 minutes to drive to school every day because I lived in the suburbs and the bus didn’t go anywhere near where I lived. Since I am planning on moving into a city when I graduate and now have experience using mass transportation, I don’t want a car and I’m not planning on moving into a large house either. I think a car would only bring me more problems than it would help me and I am planning on living alone, so I wouldn’t need a big house. The co-housing idea is really intriguing after watching Happy, so maybe that would be an option. While going “back to nature” sounds intriguing to most, including me, it would be an “environmental disaster” if more people followed Thoreau’s footsteps, as Ken explains.

I believe that the size of homes keep getting bigger because homes seem to define how well off someone is. I also believe that smaller houses can be great to reduce one’s carbon footprint. But as someone who has lived in a fairly small house because that is all my family is able to afford, I have always dreamed of living a lavish life because of how my parents have told me how their lives were. My mom once told me that when she was younger, she dreamed of having a big family and living in a big beautiful home and it’s those dreams that drive people toward their success and a big home and therefore a large carbon footprint comes in. People want to show off how far they have come in life and it’s hard to hear that they shouldn’t want it because they are negatively affecting the planet although it is the right thing to be aware of the effects.

This video has inspired me to live off the land someday. Just have a few belongings and utilize all my resources without emitting carbon period. Who needs a microapartment when you can be a nomad that lives off the land with a mastery of resources. I wish it was that easy. In all honesty, microapartments seem very doable. I practically  live in a microapartment back home because my dad built a wall in one room and mine is extremely tiny, but its enough space for me to entertain myself and get what I need done. I just see an issue with others and their enormous houses that cover an extreme amount of space. How would they ever switch to microliving? Some people live in their car and as horrible as it sounds, I can imagine it being a liveable circumstance. It’s all about what you prioritize more and a small designated space to me is enough.

I grew up in a big city, Los Angeles to be specific, this lecture video really surprised me as I truly believed that it would be more detrimental to the environment than a small town area. When learning all the good things that come from living in in a big city, such as walking to different places or using the bus system, to putting a lot of people in a smaller space to coexist, I never realized that those do good for the environment than having big houses spread out and having to drive everywhere in a small town. However, the con to this would be that the people in these living environments and conditions aren’t in the best state. It causes a lot of people to live in bad conditions are have extremely low paying jobs. However, for those that are accustomed to living in a smaller town or how living in a smaller town is viewed, living in cramped up apartments does not seem like a fun thing to do. IT causes many people to be against is cause they were raised with the idea of having their own space, with their own family. However, this is not good for the environment as state in this lecture.

The size of our homes adds a huge carbon impact on our environment. We live in a society where the size of our home essentially defines our success. However, it is imperative that we start moving to smaller homes, such as apartments, to reduce the impact we're already adding in addition to transportation, food consumption, etc. As Ken mentioned in this video, the size of our home isn’t the only carbon impact we're inducing into the world, but also the carbon we emit once living in it. Cooling or warming our homes essentially produces lots of carbon, more or less given the size of our house. Thus, living in a small home or apartment, or even living with others, would greatly reduce our carbon footprint and essentially slow climate change.

There are 7 people in my household: my parents, my 3 younger siblings, my great-grandma, and I. Our house is ALWAYS draining energy in some aspect or another. There are always too many lights on in empty rooms, too many TVs left playing while people are sleeping, too many appliances plugged in when they don’t need to be, and too much air conditioning being blasted while no one’s home. When I still lived at home I always did my part to try to conserve what I could, but I couldn’t keep track of 6 other people’s actions at all times. I try to instill my good habits into my younger siblings, but the nature of childhood tends to beat me: the TV is their night light! They leave the lights on because they didn’t want it to be dark while they left the room! They spend hours with their iPads plugged in watching YouTube because it’s fun! I obviously can’t and don’t blame them for their lack of effort. They don’t know the damage their small inactions cause, nor should they need to be burdened with it. They didn’t create the problem. My older great-grandma is simply a bit too old to remember to do the little things sometimes. Turning off a light or a TV simply slips her mind every now and then, and again, I can’t blame her for it. My parents are the ones I can’t make excuses for. They both lead busy lives, but they have to consider the lives of their children. Their actions are directly impacting the planet that their kids are going to live on for the rest of their lives. After watching Ken’s lecture, I’m hoping to sit down and have a conversation with them about why it’s critical for them to potentially change their ways.

Cities seem like they would produce much more waste, but with the right infrastructure they are much more efficient. With the growth of population expected to happen in the next few decades, the proper city planning for the growth of cities is vital to allowing the Earth to heal itself and prevent further climate change. In the United States, I see the growth of cities and micro-housing being more dominant than the co-housing option. This is mainly due to the individualistic mindset that we have. People enjoy having their own space and a change in the “American Dream” and what is considered the ideal living situation is needed in order for cohousing to really take off. It’s not normal to see several families living together not out of necessity. It really isn’t necessary for everyone to have a huge house with most of it empty. More land is used and more energy and resources are used to maintain that property and it's not even being used to its full potential. 
<br><br>
I found it very interesting how the evolution of the environmental movement can be seen in the way we approach housing. It had previously been thought that we’re more environmental if we are deeper in nature, but now it's about how we can change our current lifestyles and situations to be less wasteful. Like it was mentioned in the lecture video, it’s about bringing nature to the city. I had never thought of how the retreat to wilderness was actually more harmful because we are impeding on land that was previously untouched for the most part. If everyone did that, what good would it be? Our population is too large and will continue to grow. We have to consider our land use as well and build up instead of out. I like that Ken mentioned the quote by David Foreman “Civilization creates a rift between humans and nature”. The reality is that we need to learn to live in harmony with the environment, we can’t have one without the other.

It was interesting to see the percentage breakdown of the main determinants we have on our planet: housing equals 32% of our climate footprint, transportation 28%, having “stuff” 26% and food equating to 14%. I think a lot of these aspects of our lives translate to a sign of affluence, once you make X amount of money you want to buy a bigger house, more cars, more “stuff”, etc. Our wants to play a huge role in the downfall of our planet. It’s interesting to note that living in a city could help reduce your carbon footprint. Places like Manhattan, for example, only 1 out of 5 people drive, while the other ⅘ relies on public transportation or walking and biking. Moving to cities also helps with the housing impact because you can live in micro-apartments or co-housing. Although co-housing is mostly found in Europe. I think co-housing is an amazing alternative to housing options because you are surrounded by people that become a small community because they are living, cooking, eating, and working together. It is wild to me that houses used to be around 1000 square feet and now have increased to 2,500 square feet even though we have less people living in each house. Housing is definitely a main component to climate change that we must combat.

I agree, it was very new to see climate change broken down so mater-of-factly as to detail wear the problem comes from, as a percent, in each sector.  I honestly didn’t know housing was so impactful. Of course, a part of me wonders if that is largely based on how much heat you use, because I live in California and am rarely cold. When I am, I bundle up instead of cranking the thermostat. 
<br><br>

Also, I can’t believe how beneficial city living is to the environment. We always view cities as these kind of environmental wastelands, where all of nature has been shut out. But they actually provide humans a relatively efficient place to live.
<br><br>

I thought the question that Ken posed, “what would urban simplicity look like” was rather interesting. Immediately I imagined urban farms and tiny apartments, but cohousing seems to me like a rather beneficial option. For starters, we can live at a fairly high level of luxury without the footprint associated with it just by sharing. This also has enormous benefits on our overall well being, as co housing helps residents develop greater senses of community and belonging. We just have to relinquish this very American notion that all private property should be ours and only ours.

I agree with Ken’s point of view and accurate calculation that housing setting like one house per family might be causing a greater amount of pollution to the environment. It might not be noticed by people, since they live under good environment and wealthy family supplies so they cannot realize the long-term bigger impact causing by those slow demand processes. Moreover, there is another solution offered that people can live in a more dense environment such as apartment to avoid more pollution created. But from my point of view, I kind of disagree about this. In China, because of the huge population, most of people live in apartments, but still because of the population, a lot of pollution still be produced in a great amount. So it is true that changing our way of housing can reduce the pollution but educating girls and do family plans can help us protect the environment from the base.

“Housing and Cities “
 <br><br>
Residential size is larger in the America, I think with such large size of housing, the expansion of cities is growing massively. Therefore, the reduction of wild areas is a definite result. This means more carbon footprint is caused by human beings, which is a threat for wildlife and wild areas. Based on the video lecture, the carbon footprint has expanded four times as much as spread out. When purchasing a new house, furniture and electronic devices are necessities for new houses, items like refrigerators have large carbon gases emission. This also links to the lecture before about the growing population that would increase consumption of resources and produce more carbon footprint. I think people is testing the limits of the environment since there are still many of them did not believe greenhouse effect.

I am very heartened to hear that city living can be more environmentally sound. I think it is natural for people to gravitate together and given that it isn't too noisy or hectic, could be beneficial for people who exist increasingly in digital realms to have more people's company even if its just proximal. I also like the idea of living in a smaller house, because living in a mansion has never appealed to me and I think it would benefit us all as animals to live more closely together.

Personally, I really dislike cities. I’ve lived in NYC for a short time and it was too cramped as well as smelling of sweat and gasoline. The only city I’ve been to that I liked was Tokyo. Maybe they have already started their regreening project or they never took out nature in the first place, but there was grass and trees all over as well as having no trash on the streets. Even though I don’t like cities, I do like the idea of the regreening project. Having gardens replace lawns seems like a good use of space for food production. I don’t know if it is sustainable for the future however as when more people head to cities, there will be less horizontal space and more vertical space. Roof tops would have to have gardens to be able to hold so many people.

<p>
I think that convincing people to stray away from classic American Dream and instead have a lot less space per person than what most people would consider ideal is going to be the most challenging part of fighting the climate crisis. In our society, having more personal space is often associated with being wealthier, and better. We are constantly fed the idea that bigger is better. A person that lives in a large home is seen as more successful and desirable than someone who shares a small apartment. I think it goes along with the American ideas of independence being necessary to have freedom.  The United States was founded on the ideas of freedom and liberty, and we are constantly told that these are essential to be happy, which perhaps they are. However, we now associate freedom and liberty with lifestyles that are harmful to the environment. While having a large house may make a person feel independent and free, someone who chooses to live in a smaller space is just as free. I think society needs to stop acting like independence and freedom are the same thing. As Americans, we are free to be as independent or dependent as we desire. If anything, the idea independence is being forced upon us as a good thing, making us less free. People are fed the idea that independence is the only way to be truly happy, which is not at all true.

Before watching this video, I already knew that our homes accounted for a good amount of each of our carbon footprints. I didn't realize exactly how much though. I think those who are seen as wealthier are the ones who are actually contributing the most to CO2 emissions from their homes. People with more money tend to buy these large, luxurious houses to flaunt their success to others and end up leaving a large amount of the rooms in their houses untouched and rarely used. I know one of Ken's solutions was to reduce one's property size but that should actually be targeted to those who sit on the wealthier side. My family and I already live in a pretty small place and mostly all my friend's (we're all POC/minorities) living situations are pretty similar as well so there isn't much we can do when it comes to that solution. 
 <br><br>
Living in IV isn't much different than living back home for me. It forces a lot of us students to share these small rooms with as many people we can get to fit in there due to how expensive it can be to live out here. Trying to optimize as much space as I can in the room I share with other people is what has actually led to me becoming more of a minimalist. The more I learn from this course, the more I try to incorporate new changes into my lifestyle.

I agree with your point that I know the air conditioner and heater are going to be responsible for some amount of carbon emissions, but I don’t know it would be that much. In the lecture, Ken talks about houses in America are supersizing right now that the houses are becoming bigger and bigger in order to satisfy the demand. People love to buy big houses to show their wealth and power and also enjoy their lives in the great mansion. Because of the climate change, people can choose to downsize their house to make a difference and save our planet.

Yeah, i found the ending statement very funny! that living in a small house is a form  of climate activism, no matter how small of an impact it is. whether you are doing so for economic reasons, out of necessity, or for the climate, either way you are helping the planet! if you think about it, all housing in Isla Vista is co-housing unless you have an apartment all to yourself. I think the proper use of the term refers to houses with multiple families that share the same kitchen and bathroom, but can be applied to any house in IV with a bunch of people living in it and sharing stuff, you don't have to cook meals together to be a 'co-op'. I personally hate cities and large amounts of people, but a lot of people do like that, so good for them.

I think that out of all of the videos and the problems addressed in these videos, housing is one of the hardest to mitigate. One, houses aren’t easy to just change the same way someone can just change their diet. Two, it is incredibly difficult and sort of impossible to convince people with million dollar homes that they should move into smaller ones. I know it seems ridiculous and that this should be feasible but people like this have been lucky enough to work their whole life to make enough money to live the way they like so giving that ideal up would be a nightmare to them. As for people in cities, I think that including the maximum amount of people without any sort of health or unhealthy environment is acceptable. People who live in the cities know and accept that they will have to live in smaller spaces for expensive and for the most part, it seems like they are ok with it. I think that it also is a good idea to keep building and growing more micro apartments in the city that are advanced because hopefully it will set an example to others that it is ok to live that way.

When hearing Ken talk about co-housing, I couldn’t help but feel that that’s what many of us are already by living in the dorms, with shared bathrooms, dining commons, and 2-3 people in a room. Since we already have experience with it, it doesn’t seem like an unattainable idea at all. I distinctly remember watching a youtube documentary several years ago about a group of people living on a commune who shared a vegetable garden, kitchen responsibilities, and the like, and I couldn’t help but think that I would love to live there. It’s not only more environmentally friendly than living completely separated, but I also imagine that it would have a positive impact on mental health: families became extremely close, people actually knew and were friends with their neighbors, and they shared meals together several times a week. For me at least, this sounds ideal.
 <br><br>

When I took English 22 last year, I remember being shocked to hear Ken say that living in cities is more environmentally friendly than living in the countryside. After hearing his explanations it made complete sense, but I couldn’t help but feel that it interrupted my dream of a pastoral, Thoreauvian life in the woods. I understand that in cities, housing is more compact and public transportation more efficient, but it lacks the idyllic serenity of nature. Therefore I think it’s very important, as Ken pointed out, to bring nature into the city and, instead of looking at them as opposites, help them to coexist, because nature is very important for mental health and wellbeing.

I totally agree! When I was living at home I was dreading the thought of roommates and now I do not see why anyone could complain. Although small I have my own space and still feel like my own person. As for the commune you heard of I think that life would be so peaceful and amazing. Its always been a dream to have my own garden. Another thing I noticed while being in the dorms, is that I do not need a lot of things. The most “stuff” I have is clothing, but I wear ever piece I own!

This class has really showed me that our societal norms have really been made up. I do not need a large house or expensive car to be happy. It all depends on the people I am with and my own personal health. I think if our culture slowed down, we would cut down our consumerism and be generally happier. It would not matter where you live because everything would be practically the same. I also really enjoyed him talking about cities and transportation. My biggest problem is my car. I think we should make the infrastructure in the U.S. more sustainable and easier to access. I believe changes should be made soon and we need to educate every generation to make sacrifices to save out planet.

This week's video, "Housing and Cities", really made me sit back and reflect on my own house. While it is just my mom, my step-dad and I, our house has 4 bedrooms and only 2 are occupied, which makes me realize how totally unnecessary it is for us to have a house this large. We often don't heat the house during the winter because it just costs way too much for us to be warm in only two rooms. I agree with Ken that people do buy these "McMansions" because it has been set into our minds that if you can afford it, you should get it to simply show off, because "bigger is better".  Down sizing for us would be totally practical and honestly I feel like we wouldn't even be able to tell the difference because we don't use a lot of the rooms in our house. The micro units that Ken talked about would be a great idea to implement into Isla vistas community because not only do we have a shortage of houses but if you made these places more affordable per person, they could be a great success. The large houses on DP already have anywhere form 10-20 people in them go for hundreds up to a thousand or more dollars per month per person. If these large houses were replaced by micro units, people may be able to afford a smaller place with more personal space rather than cramming 3-5 people in one large room.

I agree with you on the fact that dowing sizing could be even better since it provides more personal spaces and is possibly a lot cheaper than it normally is. I feel like that the idea of "McMansions" and the fact that people would think "larger is better" could possibly lead to a lot of social problems. The ongoing Cola strike, for example, the lives of graduate students might have been relieved if the housing in the IV community become cheaper. However, the constructors or the leasing office might not be willing to make these rooms smaller and cozier just because they might not be as profitable as they are for now. And not to mention that large houses and cities are typically consuming more energy and contributing a lot more to Green House effect than smaller houses are.

When I was growing up, my family had very much bought into the traditional American dream. My parents wanted to live in a quiet suburban town with their three kids in as big a house as they could afford. While they had friends and certain social commitments, they didn't see the point in getting to know neighbors or creating a sense of community, and they were very much happy in their isolated home full of stuff that is completely their own. For a long time, I was with them on this, not realizing any better. Now, unfortunately, even though my views have changed, they are still very much hung up on these ideals. Now, when we talk about the future, we often end up disagreeing and debating, them thinking the key to happiness is bigger space and more stuff while I explain that my plan is to move to a city and enjoy my own micro-apartment.  I have decided that I never want a mcmansion, and the main reason isn't even climate change. Personal happiness is not found in stuff like a huge house and an assortment of cars, and I'm glad I was able to realize that before it was too late. A huge issue, both in the past and still even now, is that not enough people are realizing that, so when they hear these plans about micro-apartments and co-housing to help with climate change they only understand it as an attack on their right to a joyful life. It's a cultural norm that we need to break, or else we will continue to see families like mine, yearning for a bigger space that kills the environment in every way.

I wholeheartedly agree with you. I have always believed that less is more, especially in a home. There are so many ways to spend money and I don’t think it’s fair to say spending one way is more important than another. But these personal choices have widespread impact. Imported materials are enabling countries to keep open factories where employees are paid almost nothing. That is why excess in the home is excess strain on the environment (including others). I hope to live in a tiny house one day because of the sustainability. This is a dream that would be impractical to impose upon others. The cultural reality of America is expressed through a desire for luxury and open space. Of course I enjoy the beauty of a well dressed home. There is no denying that there is pleasure in grandeur. However, on a personal level, I feel no inclination to fill my life with things I will not appreciate in a few years time. In my own home, there are so many objects that my eyes pass right over without thought. This demonstrates to me that their utility is low and therefore they are unnecessary. I could never convince my parents of this belief. And I hope there is a generational difference in the way we see living once most of us are out on our own, for our personal sake and for the sake of the planet.

While reading your comments I noticed how different we are, I grew up from apartment to apartment and dealt with intense financial struggles at times as a kid. When you mentioned the McMansion I thought about the game MASH and thought about how much I hoped the number I chose was able to get me the mansion. Even as a kid I would think about how life would be easier for my family if we had the barbie dreamhouse mansion that I used to play with in real life. I never was mad at my parents or hated them for the life I had I was grateful and happy, it didn't matter, but I always hoped for more. Maybe a little more money to keep the lights on or keep the hot water running, but at the end of the day it humbled me and made me appreciate my parents. We didn't have everything, but I had a whole lot of love and that's what mattered, not anything else. Being in a house wouldn't have done much to my happiness now that I think about it as the property doesn't matter it was the people who I was with that do as anywhere I go is home as long as I'm with them. I feel like creating a sense of community where there is love and compassion can go a long way for so many people without needing the giant mansions and most expensive products, just coming together and being there for one another goes a long way.

Housing size keeps increasing even though family sizes keep decreasing. It would make sense for us to live in smaller spaces, but that is not the case. Instead, people dream of buying big houses. The big house symbolizes wealth and success. I’ve never had the specific dream of having a big house with a yard, but I understand the appeal. I found Ken’s solution of co-housing communities to be challenging. I’m not sure if it’s necessarily realistic, but it could be an effective solution. I loved living in the dorms, and I still live with my six of my closest friends in a small apartment on Del Playa. Sharing spaces with other people is a definite way to reduce my carbon footprint. However, I’m young and cannot afford my own housing. The goal is to move up in life, and in our society, moving up means owning my own property. I’m a huge city girl, and  it makes me happy to hear that living in a big city can actually be the most effective way to reduce my carbon footprint. In a city, I’d walk more, own less stuff, and have more local food options available to me. Sounds good to me!

The statistic that "in 1950, the average size of an American house was just under 1000 square feet and today, the average size of an American house is over 2500 square feet (more than 2 1/2x larger)" really resonated with me. It is so true that we as Americans do not need to live in as big of houses as we currently do and take up as much space, considering the fact that in the past even bigger families lived in small spaces and made do with what they had. I think that this all goes to serve as an example of the American Dream. We grow up with the mindset that bigger is better and the more stuff and the bigger your house is, the more successful you must be. However, this is not true and simply just a materialistic view that has evolved over time in our consumeristic, fast paced society. We just buy what we want when we want and this can be seen with fast fashion as well. 
 <br><br>
We need to work to reduce our carbon footprint and in doing so, downsize the resources that we consume everyday. Recently, I have been seeing a lot of videos in my Youtube show up of people documenting their experience living in tiny homes. In addition, I have seen a lot of Japanese tiny homes where people are still able to live in a nice home, just more sustainably. If so many people can do it, why can't we? I believe that if these tiny homes get more news coverage, they will be able to slowly build popularity over time and become something more common among the population. As of now, the mindset is that mansions are what we should aim to purchase as a representation of our wealth. It will take a lot before that mindset changes otherwise.

I remember during my sophomore year of high school, my English teacher showed the class a video about tiny houses. I remember thinking, those look very inconvenient--why would anybody want to live in these homes? It's obviously a much different case now that I realize that they are beneficial for the environment, and not just some random lifestyle change done for the sake of it. Looking at house sizing in the context of the environment, it is very interesting that larger houses have become the "norm" in American culture. Having a large house definitely stems from the classic sentiment of the American dream, in which Americans idealize larger things. Americans literally think, "the more is better," which is such a harmful mindset to have, and definitely stems from the nation's reliance on capitalistic values. We don't theoretically need to have large houses, yet it is quite common for people to seek grander and grander houses, because it is a representation of monetary wealth. Americans love to act out of self-interest, it's ingrained in the culture to sacrifice the natural beauty of the Earth in exchange for something that benefits themselves.

I also first learned about tiny houses in highschool. I thought quite the opposite though. Tiny houses look very comfortable. I don’t require that much space, so a tiny house is perfect. Rather than it being the fault of Americans, I think everyone acts out of self interest. The only difference is that businesses have had a much larger sway on the American public and much more room to advertise, giving Americans different values compared to the rest of the world. An example is the diamond business. Diamonds weren’t originally as important to marriage as they are today. Because of the relentless advertising of diamond companies, diamond rings are now an integral part of the American marriage and it is seen as improper not to have a diamond ring. Hopefully as more people become aware of where they get their preconceptions of wealth, they will abandon these recent traditions for a more sustainable lifestyle.

I love that your high school English teacher showed you tiny houses! Living in Isla Vista, I feel as though we're all in tiny houses. I love living with six people in my tiny apartment on DP. I never realized how environmentally friendly it was until recently. It's very normal to have roommates nowadays. My dad does not understand how or why I live with so many people, but I can't imagine living alone.

I agree with other folks who have said that these videos do not really concern intersectional issues as they pertain to the climate crisis. Choices in housing is not something that everyone has accessibility to, and the aspiration to own property has always remained a core part of the American dream; it’s impossible to detangle the two ideas, property and success, from each other, rendering many of these mini-house or communal living options as ridiculous to most folks. 
 <br><br>


In NYC in particular, people may not be using cars as frequently as in other cities, but that statement didn’t take into account the cost of owning a vehicle. The cost is outlined somewhat, but framed more as an expensive that can be eliminated if you make the choice to do so. As I’ve mentioned in other comments, despite the huge reliance on the public transit system in NYC, the price of a ride is becoming cost-prohibitive for many folks. These solutions to the climate crisis have to offer incentive in order for folks to utilize them, not place more barriers in the way, and these things should be mentioned. 
 <br><br>


Again, in discussing other measures that can be taken in certain areas, such as rooftop gardens or vertical farms, the videos don’t really include the costs or labor that goes into the implementation of these things. When discussing the climate crisis, it’s important to show all perspectives, not just the one of being able to make whatever changes one wants at their will.

From this lecture video, I learned that smaller housing areas would be more beneficial for the environment. Because larger houses take up so much space of the environment, there are less spaces to accommodate to the problems that the environment is going through in the moment. I applaud Ken for helping me and other students learn various ways on how to help our planet and better its conditions. However, unfortunately, I hope Ken realizes that most of the people who live in "tiny" houses are those who cannot afford bigger houses. Convincing these less comfortable people to move into smaller houses can simply seem a little unfair because they can't even afford a better house in the first place.  I believe that we should first understand the living situations that people are going through in this country and also other places. And then if they can accommodate to the planet with everything that is going on right now in their lives and the planet, then it should be done with planning.

I think it depends on the person. I think they are homeless people who would love to have a roof over their head. Fixing homelessness could help the environment. The government could provide public housing and get people off the streets. Planning should be involved but it costs 20 billion dollars to fix homelessness in this country.

Housing is to me is something so important. Buying a big house in America is also one of my dreams. Why? Because it is so cheap. Even the houses in Beverly Hills, if you convert its prices in dollar per ft^2 and compare them with the housing price in Beijing, you will find out that they are still way cheaper. In my hometown, 1200 ft^2 cost almost two millions dollar. Do remember that this area counted is based upon the living area+shared area. The actual living area inside of this 1200 ft^2 house is just 900 ft^2 at most, and we do not own the land under it as well, so it should be named condo more officially. But in America, the same prices, a much much bigger house or even houses, and ownership of the land under it and the sky above it. How different is that, how hard for to give up my dream to buy a big house here.

<p>
Overall, I agree with how good smaller houses are. The only problem is that whenever they are promoted, they want better living conditions. Yes, smaller houses should be easier to use and can accommodate lower budgets, but Ken should also be aware that there are many ethnic minorities who basically live in urban “micro-houses” simply because they ca n’t Burden others. Land and houses are not scarce. Location is scarce. Even at the very least, families still rely on cars for low-paying jobs. The bus is an option, but it is so unreliable. That's why public transport needs to be improved, but it's just one of the many issues we see in the video. How you live your life does not depend on how you view the quality of your life, nor how much money you invest in your home.

Housing and cities are one of the greatest causes of climate change and greenhouse gases releasing. Since when we are building houses and cities, we release a lot of greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases released by the building are around 25% of total releasing.  And the houses that an American family is living into becoming bigger and bigger, which costs more and more construction and release more and more greenhouse gases. But we can't blame people on this. This is what the American dream is. When people are hardworking, they can buy a bigger house and live in there. This is what makes people work hard.

This week's video is pretty interesting to me as an international student from China. Most people in China live in apartments (which makes sense because of our population). I grew up in a city called Chongqing, which is a megacity (the kind of city that has over 10 million population) in southwest China, according to Wikipedia. I was so used to the convenience of living in a city, and it became one of the things that made me feel difficult to live in Santa Barbara. I never get why there are so many American people living in a big house in a suburban area. I visited such a place which is one of my mom's friend's friend's home during my first year's winter break. I literally had nothing to do, and they had to drive everywhere. How is this near to nature if it's based on you keep harming it?
 <br><br>

In my home in Chongqing, there is a subway station right under where I live. There is also a subway station near my high school. Mass transportation there really spoiled me. How could you not fall in love with it when it's cheap, convenient, accessible, and so easy for you to take a look at the city's view and the trees and the rivers and people. Let's face it. The view you see when driving a car is always limited. Also, I love living in an apartment and with other people. I don't know why there is a perspective that it means you are rich when you live in a house. Compared to those mansions (which are owned by lots of celebrities) where you have to walk for five minutes to reach somewhere, I like my stuff is all in one place and put together closer. Apartments actually feel more like homes than houses to me. 
 <br><br>

And I absolutely love the idea of co-housing. Being here for three years, I always have a roommate. Though most of the time, I didn't get to choose who my roommates are, it is nice to have someone to talk to. Anyway, knowing there are so many benefits in terms of environmental impact, I insist on my ideas to continue to live in apartments and cities. Hopefully, I can also find a co-housing community that I feel comfortable to be with.

After watching this week’s lecture video, Housing and Cities. Ken Hiltner’s suggestion of co-housing communities could be a solution or serve as an alternative to reduce our personal carbon footprint based on our housing. Living in smaller housing, growing your own vegetables, and sharing with the community, all of those seem like favorable lifestyle choices. Moving to cities is a very promising way to reduce carbon emissions as it forces a change in one's entire lifestyle. I've seen how in Japan there are hundreds of micro-apartments, which is actually extremely common to live in places like Tokyo. My house in Isla Vista has eight people and it is a very small house. I feel as though this is very economically and environmentally efficient because of the people per square foot in this house and how little resources we are using because we have to share everything we have with multiple people.

While I agree that growing your own vegetables is a nice addition to food-related climate change solutions, we have to remember that it’s really only applicable to those with a higher income and less hardships in life. It can be pricey to set up and it takes time to maintain, and those with lower incomes often don’t have time or money to spare. Then again, it IS the wealthier (and more selfish) countries who contribute the most to climate change, and therefore we should be the ones to take the most action toward mitigating the crisis. This will also take the strain off of the countries who are being the most affected despite their lack of contribution toward global warming and climate change. 
  <br><br>

I do agree that co-housing communities are a great solution to reducing our carbon footprint, though. They lower the per person square footage consumption, as well as water usage, electricity usage, and heating (gas) usage, since everything in the household will be shared by multiple people. Co-housing communities also offer a great opportunity to make friends and build a support system with those living around you. While I had been introduced to this kind of living in the past during school trips, camps, and other “community” events, I really first became immersed in this lifestyle when I first moved into the residence halls here at UCSB. I was scared of having a roommate and never getting “alone time”. I thought it would be frustrating to share bathrooms and carry a “shower caddy” down the hall every time I wanted to shower. I thought it would be difficult to find quiet spaces. However, I quickly grew to love living in the residence halls more than I could have ever imagined. I met my closest friend due to us being roommates, and I met my other close friends due to us living in the same hallway. I’m learning to be more careful and thoughtful about my actions, because I know that what I do directly affects those around me. And I would not change anything for the world.

The use of fossil fuel needs to stop if we want change to occur. I watched a documentary called Living The Change and it was about fossil fuels. Watching Living The Change opened my eyes about what is affecting the planet's environment and contributing to climate change. I appreciated how all topics were discussed, from consumerism to farming. One expert in the film said that at least eighty percent of the known available fossil fuels needs to remain underground. She then continued on and said, "it doesn't matter how many solar panels are set up around the globe, the thing that matters is keeping those fossil fuels underground." I do agree with this statement but I don't think it is likely to happen because these big fossil fuel companies are extremely powerful and have a lot of money to persuade political leaders. So in order for things to improve, people all over the world have to unite against these companies and say no to the use of fossil fuels. Although seeing this did give me hope, I am not too optimistic about the future of our planet. Many economies are based on fossil fuels, so the transition to not using it will be extremely difficult. I am going to do my part and not ride on any planes and try to refrain from riding a car as much as possible. Hopefully more students enrolled in this course try to follow Ken's footsteps and instead of using a car as a main form of transportation, people opt to use an electric bike.

I have no problem with saying that homes are much too large for people who own them. I fully realize that this is a fact and it is our reality, especially here in the U.S. However, in this class I feel like this is something that we have gone over a couple of times. There is obviously a problem with the wasting of space and consumer products in the United States, but there if we are going to repeat segments of this class I think one thing we should be continually pushing to our students and fellow classmates is that we need to get individuals to take and action and get politicians who care about this issue into the correct places. I don't think that we will ever progress in anyway in regard to the climate change until we discover a way to actually get enough of the population to become educated on this problem. If we were able to get politicians into office they could address this, as Ken says, as a cultural problem. If we did this it would to only solve the housing problem but it would also solve things such as the food waste problem in America. How would this be? well it is very simple if more people were educated on the climate crisis then more people would practice activism and practices that would mitigate this issue. So, if  there was going to be something that we reiterate in this class then I would hope that it would be that people need to vote and try to get others to care more about this issue. If we are able to accomplish that then I think that we would be able to create movement in a positive direction so much more quickly then we have ever seen before. In turn this could help create houses to be more reasonable sizes and it could help to squash a myriad of other problems that we must tackle if we are to combat the climate change.

As long as there are McMansions for people to buy, people will buy. The problem with downsizing one's home is that it contradicts everything we have ever heard about living a successful lifestyle. You only hear about eccentric people who live in tiny houses or relatively modest living spaces in order to spend more on traveling. That is the idea that I have in my head when I think about upgrading to a smaller home or moving to busier city. As much as this is a personal decision, I think it is a government and architectural responsibility. But I can not support the suggestion of sacrificing so much for the benefit of the planet. Ken has given us a lot of advice on how to be proactive about combating climate change in our daily life, but there comes a moment where the decisions we are given infringe on our liberty. People who can not afford to live in big houses are already the least to contribute to green house emission and have a far better carbon footprint. In suggesting that they should continue to live in an apartment and bus to work is not fair. My parents did not come to this country to continue living small, but to achieve a better status. That is probably one of the biggest driving factors for immigrants to come to this country, to live the American dream. Such a suggestion is possible for those who can afford it, for others it is not a choice.

Nowadays, the average housing area for a American is increasing two and half times in 70s. People should concern whether they indeed use such large area to live. When we re thinking about environmental problems, we always ignore the problem of housing. We always buy a lot, not only because of our desire, but also because we have enough space to accommodate them. If we can decrease the area we can use, we will think whether we should buy the item or whether we have enough space to lace such item we rarely use. Thus, reducing housing  area will be a plausible and effective way to help us protect our environment. Professor Ken always teach us such useful ways to protect the environment and appeal us or communicate with other about protecting the environment.

I live in catalina which is a big dorm that can accommodate thousands of students. Actually we need apartments like this. This can save lands and make it more efficient. Imagine that thousands of students want to live in houses. More lands are gonna be used for building houses. This not only costs wastes of materials for building them, but also lands. These lands can be used for planting more trees for building a better ecosystem. Many people think bigger houses bring more comfort, but this is not always true. If you want to your houses, it is becoming very difficult. You have two options: 1. cleaning by yourself which is really tired. 2. hiring someone cleaning it for you. For people who want to save budgets, apartments are more suitable. As the city grows, the city becomes more crowded, so it is necessary to build more apartments. Especially for island cities, they have to build higher apartments to solve problems for land uses. Take Hong Kong as an example, as the city become more crowded, the government builds more taller apartments to solve problems for too much population. This happens everywhere in many regions. Building such houses can indeed reduce the problems of land uses.

I think that it is really interesting that living in a big city, which is normally considered polluted and a bit dirty, can actually be extremely sustainable. Before learning all of this, the idea of living in a more rural area had always sounded nice to me, but clearly living in a city is a very important factor in combatting the climate crisis. You can walk more instead of driving and live in smaller apartments, which seems better since it is cost effective and easier to maintain. It is really important that more people understand the benefits of living in cities since many probably have always had the same mindset that cities are bad for the environment.
  <br><br>

I also think it is pretty crazy to hear about how much the housing size has increased even though families are actually getting smaller and how easy it would be to live in a smaller space, but people continue to want to buy the largest houses that they can afford. However, I definitely relate to this-- I don't think it is many kids' dreams or definition of success to live in a tiny apartment; I've always imagined my future house to be two stories and to have a lot of space. It is not easy to readjust your values and beliefs, especially for the people already living in larger houses, but it also is not really a choice based on how detrimental our actions are to the environment. We all will have to make some sacrifices for the greater good, but it also is helpful to realize that we do not necessarily have to view the changes that need to be made as "sacrifices" or things that we will be missing out on. There are a lot of great things that come with these changes, but many only see the negatives.

I've definitely noticed a change in the things I want from housing. I don't see what's so great about having a huge house anymore, even though when I was younger I always wanted a big fancy house. Practically I see a smaller house as the better option now, less space to have to clean, and I wouldn't have any useless spots in my house. I feel like bigger houses also encourage individuals to acquire more things that are useless. Like do you really need a whole room for a pool table? No, you just want it, but if your house doesn't have space for it then you won't get it, problem solved. I think living smaller is the best scenario, it makes it feel more cozy and homey. Plus, I won't feel like there's a murderer lurking around in a tinier house, ya feel? I'm sure some of y'all have been home alone before in a bigger house and felt like there was someone lurking in your house, but if it's smaller there's less chance someone could be hiding in your house. Ok that was a tangent, but anyway I would prefer city living over suburban living. IV is really nice because everything is in close proximity, I don't have to own a car because of that, and If I need to go to the actual city there is a great public transit system. My carbon footprint has decreased by a lot since coming to Isla Vista, and I think if we could have more communities as eco friendly as IV then we'd be in a step in the right direction. I've also been to Japan where housing is significantly smaller, and that's normal. Even the rich over there tend to keep their houses on the smaller more compact side. The way they have their houses set up over there is intriguing and I somewhat prefer that to how housing is over here in the US. There are so many aspects of housing that we could change to become more environmentally friendly in the US, if only we took some ideas from other places that have pretty much mastered their living situations to be more sustainable.

When I was first introduced to the concept of micro-apartments and tiny homes I thought they were the most brilliant idea ever and I felt like they could be so beneficial to developed countries that have a large population and that want to help combat the climate crisis in economic ways. As Ken has previously stated that 55% of the world's population lives in cities as of now and by 2050 that percentage is expected to increase to more than 67%. Developing micro-apartments and tiny homes could help many cities in the United States that are already experiencing housing and homeless crises. A climate-conscious solution that is killing two birds with one stone some might say. Give the city of Los Angeles as an example, the city has a big homeless crisis going on as well as a housing crisis. The citizens of LA are seeing their rent go up and good quality housing is disappearing thus fueling and feeding its homeless population which makes it a vicious cycle. If we used tiny homes and micro-apartments then we are using a solution that is more eco-friendly as well as addressing some big problems that involve housing. In the United States, we need to turn away from this culture that bigger is better because tiny homes and micro-apartments seem like excellent solutions to so many problems.

I agree that micro-apartments are a really great idea for so many reasons. For one, they are more environmentally responsible. I remember in English 22 we talked about how micro-apartments were helping people, especially students, afford rent in highly populated and otherwise extremely expensive cities such as LA or NY. They make it easier for students to live alone without the detrimental living costs affecting their quality of education. I never really considered how big cities can be more environmentally sound than rural areas because of all the pollution, traffic, lack of trees and wildlife, and the inability to further develop. However, the fact that only 1 in 5 people commute to work by car as opposed to public transportation gives me hope that some good can come from developing big cities. What we need to do now is popularize the micro-apartment by highlighting the cheaper cost and greater accessibility to big-city amenities to hopefully persuade Americans to move away from our "bigger is better" attitude and change the culture altogether.


<br><hr>

I recognized the efficiency of micro-aprartments for preserving our environment as well as the socio-economic pressures that dictate our way of living. Most of our capitalist and consumerist tendencies are shaped by the things that we don't have. When we recognize that cities are expensive and we can't afford to live in a place with a lot of opportunities, we start developing this mindset that we have to make more, have more, own more, just to belong. However, having a big apartment or an expensive house does not define our value and worth as living entities. Our contribution to the world both the good and  bad is what matters. The city for me is actually a really negative influence to the everyday consumer. The more concentrated we are in a city the more we demand for things that are convenient and affordable because of the undeniable expenses we have to prioritize. We can't worry about what food to eat that's environmental friendly because we are focused on how are we going to pay for our next meal.

I always feel lucky to watch Ken's videos. They provide a lot of information related to the climate crisis and give possible solutions to us to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. This video suggests the actions we can take on housing. A lot of resources and energies are used for a large housing supply. I was firstly surprising by the fact that average housing area for a American had been increased by more than two and a half times in 70 years. Now as everyone is getting rich, people are affordable for a bigger house. Normally every family with four members in average is living in an individual house. The increased housing area is consuming the Earth resources and causing environmental issues. Either heating or cooling the house releases great amount of greenhouse gases, especially a bigger house releases more. As everyone requires bigger houses now, the size of cities increases also. Some people choose to live at the suburb area, which requires driving as the transportation. The use of cars releases greenhouse gases and contributes a lot on leaving the climate footprint. The increased human habitat may affect the original habitats for plants and animals. It break the balance of the ecosphere which may causes extinctions. I was very sad to see a lot of forests are mostly damaged and trees which absorb carbon dioxide are cut because of the enlarged human habitats. Ken's video mentions problems we currently have, and one of solution to overcome it is to choose to live in a small house or cohouse in cities. I prefer small areas than bigger house because they give me safety and I don't need to offer a lot of efforts to clean them. If I have a chance to live in a small apartment in the future, I will definitely choose it.

Every time I look around Isla Vista (and, really, almost anywhere in California), I get mad at the housing. Specifically, that every single building is just way too damn short. Tiny homes are good and all, smaller houses and great, but the absolute best thing if we want denser cities, closer transit, and saving carbon through having more efficient and closer cities... is just building UP!!! Call me a "YIMBY," but I just chafe at every single one of our buildings that seems allergic to building more than one or two floors. I'm living in Santa Ynez right now, and while I love my apartment, and five whole people can fit into a fair-sized apartment, it would just be so many thousands of times better if each house was built up four or five stories taller! You could fit five people in a building, OR you could fit twenty. Which is better? The answer is obvious! 

  <br><br>


This honestly makes me mad when I think about most "tiny houses," too. You know, the gentrified trailer parks. So much land is taken up, so much actual space, and these tiny homes end up being.. one room, one floor. No building up, no actual density. It doesn't help with transit, it doesn't help with having livable cities, it doesn't help with rent and barely helps with climate. 
  <br><br>

I love Isla Vista-- and California-- far more than I love the east coast (where I'm originally from). But dear god, I hate how nothing here can build up at all. It's a damn crime that leads to our insane rent prices, far more emissions than we need, and cities that are simply less livable than they could be. Just a shame all-around, and I really wish we could just fix it.

After watching your lecture on Housing and Cities, I can now say that I understand even more of what I can do to combat the climate crisis that before. I always thought that living in cities would account for more pollution, partly because places like Los Angeles are disgusting, but now I see that it is actually more eco friendly. I feel like each week (honestly each day) I learn a new thing that I can utilize in my life either now or in the future that will help combat climate change. I agree with everything you said in which we need to either live in smaller houses, or live in the city to reduce our carbon footprint. I think one day we will all get to this point, it's just a matter of when. Along with this, cities also made me think it was bad for the environment because there was no nature surrounding me. I think we just need to educate more people on the environmental benefits to living in smaller housing or cities.

I fully agree! Ken's lecture on Housing and Cities offered a fresh perspective and a new approach to combat the climate crisis. Your reference to how we commonly think of cities as hotbeds/epicenters for pollution and environmental degradation even though they are actually beneficial for the environment really resonated with me.  Now, my hope of living in a big city in the future is also reinforced by the fact that it contributes in an eco-friendly fashion.  You also mentioned that we will eventually start living in smaller houses and in more urban areas/cities. In my opinion, more and more people (especially in our generation) will gravitate towards densely populated metropolitan areas in the future, but on the other hand, don't think people will be keen on living in smaller spaces. As referenced in one of Ken's previous lectures, it really stuck with me how although people are having fewer children, they still continue to expand or increase the size and square footage of their homes. Ultimately, I hope urban living becomes more appealing, accessible, and popular to our society as we move forward in the fight against climate change.

After watching Ken’s video, i felt like i am actually living in an environmental friendly life-style. I live in a small triple room with my two roommates and share one kitchen which include a refrigerator and a few bathroom with people live in the same floor with me. There’s no air conditioner in our room as the weather is cool. I don’t own a car and i walk to the classroom everyday although there’s a relatively distance between my room and classroom. Most of the students i campus own a bike and they ride their bike to the classroom which is a environmental friendly way too. In addition, there is a convenient bus system in the city, so students who live out of the campus can take the bus back to school or students can take public transportation to almost anywhere in this city.  As Ken’s say in the lecture, living in a “micro apartment” or “certain choosing communities” can largely reduce carbon footprint. As well as taking public transportation or riding bicycles. Our campus life are actually pretty fit in the concept. It’s important for people to change their thought of larger house is better as the astonishing data shown in the lecture that almost 1/3 American carbon footprint comes from our home and 80 metric tons are released to build a typical house. I never thought that we are releasing carbon dioxide even though we are just living and staying in our home. Though, the lecture gave out a way to largely reduce the released carbon footprint without loosing any necessary daily tools which is moving to a micro apartment or certain choosing communities. And an effective and simple way is to move to the city and this can approach both of the requirements. Living in the city can greatly reduced climate footprint. In addition to the reason of smaller and more efficient house, the other reasons is that mass transportation and bicycles in the city lead to the less use of car.

I feel the same way. Living in a dorm style housing makes you realize that it’s actually not all that hard living with less. Of course the McMansion style might be the ideal for many people however they should realize that other options are there for them. Being on a university campus where so many students walk, bike, or bus makes me realize that if cities improved public infrastructure and transportation more people would utilize it. I wish there were more options of cohousing in the US like Denmark. This would help in reducing the carbon footprint for many Americans. The suburbs are also largely romanticized which leads people to think that living in micro apartments means they haven’t “succeeded”. However the idea of doing things that are better for the environment need to be more popularized. Yes using a metal straw is helpful to the environment but in the long run better housing and transportation options will do much more for the environment.

When I was younger, I would complain to my parents about not having a big enough house and whined that we needed one. Today, I am fine where we are living and when I eventually move out, I want to live in a city. Since I was born in Chicago, IL, I have always wanted to live in a city and have dreamed of moving back there or some other city. I just love everything being so close to me and being surrounded by so many people. I have also been fascinated about how living in a small apartment would be beneficial to the environment due to how much less space it takes compared to home. We honestly do not have that much space because we just fill it up with items to fill up the space. I feel with a smaller space to begin with, we will be less obligated to buy items that will fill it up. It is crazy to imagine that we were once a time where the average house today was much smaller than they are now. It only goes to show how much our culture has changed and where our values are held. We need to change these values because it is destroying our planet. Changing our way of life will make us happier as well because we will not have the need of validating ourselves with a bunch of stuff. I am hoping that I can make the change where I can become a minimalist and only have what I need. I will not only do the planet a favor, but I will be doing myself one as well.

A big house is the American dream! It's been advertised since I was a kid; the end goal is to end up with a big house. This is what I used to believe in. However, after these past few years I personally realized that I don't want a big house, I'd prefer a small house with a big yard, but hey that's just me. I believe most Americans want that big house that will take a lot of energy to keep warm or cool depending on the season. It's hard to rebrand the American dream of that big house. It takes spreading the awareness with a video like this and just keeping the right conversation about the climate crisis. Everyone is allowed to have a dream but I think everyone must be aware of the impact it has. keeping the awareness of climate change is a challenge for society but is something that must be done. This video was filled with information that can help educate anyone about how housing impacts the climate crisis.

I have always believed that living in the city will cause more pollution and generally reduce the quality of life, because sound and light pollution will prevent people from sleeping well, and the stress of work and social life will make people very busy. As a result, living physically and mentally in cities and suburbs will be healthier. But I have never considered the environmental differences between urban and rural areas. As Ken said, the government encourages people to live in rural areas because they can enjoy a simpler, carefree life while “reducing” pollution in general. To say. The video mentions that the government ’s idea is just propaganda for increasing car consumption, and it does not help the environment. I am shocked. As a person who has lived in the city all his life, there is no real personal preference between urban and rural, but after watching this video, my views on the city have changed a lot. I finally got answers about the benefits of living in the city.
  <br><br>
From the documentaries and personal experiences I have seen, it is clear that bigger is not always better. Only this is money, but money will not bring you real happiness. I don't want to say that those who already have a luxury life can easily change their small life, but for those who have not yet made a decision, I think it should be firmly considered. Not only will it make you more space conscious, it will also help you significantly reduce your carbon footprint.

I feel that a big part of why cities seem detrimental to the climate is that there are so many people living there and it's so densely populated. However if you took a city's population and spread it throughout a suburb, that suburb would have way more houses and way more space for each person. In many cities, people choose not to own a car because traffic can be crazy and it's much more convenient to walk or use public transportation. More cities should follow this model as more are built. This way, as people live in smaller places and live closer to where they work, they can take care of the living situation and transportation situation and it'll be beneficial to the environment.

Learning about the ratio between the size of the houses in America versus those in Japan was something that was very interesting because of the fact that Japanese houses are so much smaller, yet they are able to fit around the same amount of people as those in American homes. Also, learning that around 30% of our energy expenditure comes from our house whether it be lighting, cooling or heating shows that we are able to reduce our emissions much more if we just lived in more eco friendly houses that aren’t excessive. The fact that the average American is using 2.5 times their carbon allotment for their home is something that should be fixed. We are literally going over what we should be allowed to do and that in turn is completely harming the planet. We need to be able to do something that can prevent this from happening in the future where we can control the amount of energy that we are expending within our homes. Something small that anyone can do is simply turning off the lights or turning off the water faucet earlier. Simple things like these can add up and later on prove to be something super beneficial to our carbon emissions. Living in a city is something interesting to think about due to the fact that everything is closer and everything is much more attainable. Living spaces in cities are smaller which may lead to lower energy usage. Because everything is closer, transportation would be a different situation which could lead to the increased usage of public transportation which would also help carbon emissions. This is something that is very important because the more condensed a place is, the more we have to adapt in comparison of living in a suburb such as we do now. For me living in a mostly suburban area has been integrated in me since birth, but ever since learning about the benefits of living in the city, I would be down to make the change so that I can reduce my footprint.

I appreciate how Ken came back to revisit this topic after we had a greater knowledge about the climate crisis and its entirety. It is crazy to me that people feel the need to live in such giant mansions and build extra parts onto that house that are so unecessary--a pool house, a guest house, etc. While these are definitely ways to show off financial success and wealth, they are harmful in the sense that they are wasting energy (think cooling and heating and how much energy that uses on a small space that is rarely used). It isn’t some crazy concept that you can live in smaller spaces--Ken mentions the Japanese homes and everyone know about the “tiny home” craze that is going on right now. The reality is bigger is not better for environmental purposes and a normal or smaller home is perfectly fine. Personally, when I move in the future and am looking into further schooling (we will see) I will make an effort to live in a city with a great housing system and awesome public transportation. While I know I am not the perfect example of living an environmentally friendly life, I want to make decisions that are good for the environment as much as I can.

The video “Housing and Cities” was very eye-opening for me. Coming from a suburb, I always used to see cities as places with lots of pollution and trash. I never saw them as environmentally friendly. However, after taking English 22 and 23 this year, my viewpoint had completely changed. Large homes known as McMansions are simply not environmentally sustainable. These homes require large amounts of energy and natural resources to build and live in. Building a typical house uses a carbon footprint of 80 metric tons of carbon. All though these houses will be around for decades, it still will use nearly one-quarter of an Americans carbon footprint. Most of these homes are outside of the cities that the homeowners work in. This means the homeowner will have to commute to work by car most likely due to the lack of public transportation from suburbs to cities in the United States. On contrast, city living offers more sustainable housing and transportation. In Manhattan, only 1 in 5 people commute to work by car. This means by living in a city you can drastically cut down on your carbon footprint due to the option to commute by bus, subway, train, or bicycle. Even though 55 percent of the world's population lives in cities, this number will continue to grow and hopefully will help mitigate the climate crisis. I believe a huge reason many people are against living in a city is due to how crowded they are and the lack of peace that suburbs or rural living can offer. Also living in cities can be expensive if you wish to live in nicer areas. But at the end of the day, city living is going to be continually improved and offer just as much green and natural places.

The beginning of this lecture video really scared me.  I feel totally receptive to information but hearing over and over about our allotted carbon allowance and how we keep surpassing it is just scary and confusing.  It just seems like everything we do creates carbon and every one of our actions is eating away at the percentages that would preserve a healthy planet.  It just is crazy to me that businesses are the ultimate power and that individuals and individual companies have just been allowed to run rampant for so many years with so little consequence.  Finding out that the average house in Japan has almost half the square footage of the smallest American homes is just mind boggling.  Since the 50s and 60s consumer culture has been allowed to grow exponentially and its just surprising there is no entity that has the power to question it.  Why do we deem these things necessary?? Why are we so reluctant to consider that maybe we don't need all the things we thought we did.  Its okay to admit a wrong doing, but not okay to hold on to arbitrary comforts and deny any part of the issue.  There is so much space owned by the American homeowner, far too much compared to how many people in america have to live homeless, or how many people across the globe don't live in sufficient housing.  It is just crazy to me how American has allowed itself to afford all of the things we deem comforts, and in the process strip billions of people of those same comforts just for our own pleasure and ease.  What authority can intervene?? What is the influence that will make us second guess our harmful tendencies?

My viewpoint on cities has changed as well since taking this class! It’s good to know that this class is changing people’s perspectives, that’s how we should always learn! I also come from a suburb and used to see most cities as a pool for poor hygiene, ridden with trash, and have lost touch with nature. And when I would go to cities they would feel like concrete jungles, it felt uncomforting. And I also agree with you that this is a huge reason many people are against living in a city.  But my perspective has changed because of this class, and this video! Yes cities can be unhealthy and have these issues, but they also have so much potential to be green, which can aid in fixing these issues. Like Ken points out, everyone one in five new homes in the U.S. are over 3,000 square feet. I’ve grown up in houses under 1,000 square feet my whole entire life and I have always had more than enough room. Maybe this is just me personally, but I would much rather have a house that has more outside space than inside space. It makes you appreciate the space you do have inside, but it also allows you to spend more time outside, hence gaining more of an appreciation towards nature. 
   <br><br>

I wonder what could happen if we took this approach to cities. By living in micro apartments we can take advantage of vertical space more. Building up instead of out would allow us to have more space for things like parks and community spaces. This is a way to infuse culture with nature. By making nature more central to cities we can help people gain an appreciation and connection to nature that they didn’t have before. You are what you surround yourself with, wouldn’t the world be a little happier if we had less chaotic cities and more calm and degrown cities? Less work, less infrastructure, more space for nature, more time for human connections. 
   <br><br>

Something we HAVE to take into account when discussing city living is the cost of living adjustment that’s needed. In so many cities you’ll end up paying thousands of dollars in rent a month for a one bed one bath apartment. This is not okay. How can you expect people to eat and be happy when they can’t even afford their rent? So yes let’s please make cities more green. Let’s change the system and make housing actually affordable to accurately reflect how much we are getting paid. We can’t just sit here and blame people for things like how 32% of American’s climate footprint comes from our homes when we have systems in place to make us this wasteful. We’ve been tricked into thinking more is better and that has affected our carbon footprint massively! We must reteach ourselves to live more sustainably and put systems and laws in place that support this in order to make systematic changes that’ll last and actually affect our lives. Just like Ken mentioned, we NEED to rethink our image of cities, and we must do so now.
<br><hr>
After watching this video, we can learn about that things related to housing are emitting so many CO2 like cooling and heating or lighting, etc. And housing takes a large part in our individual carbon footprint averagely. So as Ken mentioned increasing home insulation and putting photovoltaic solar cells in our roofs are surely worthy of adopting in our daily life. But additionally, what is more important and effective to combat climate crisis is that we should move to micro apartments, or literally move to a city which can easily reduce our carbon footprint about transportation and housing. Micro apartments with everything we need substituted are supported and tested to be an ideal home by publics. And there is people arguing that life in Manhattan is greener than life in Wyoming. After all, all of these choices are effective forms of climate activism which could help us mitigate the side effect of climate change.

I think the largest problem is changing the way we live because it's how we have lived for so long. Automobiles, electricity, fossil fuels, and large homes have become such an essential part of American consumerism culture-- it is difficult for Americans to grasp the idea that this is not a sustainable portrayal of what life should be.  We have to be realistic about how people can change their lifestyles so that people will actually be open-minded to the possibility of changing the way they live. Something that I realized is that most of the propositions that Ken suggests come from an extremely privileged point of view.  You have to be financially stable to implement such changes, Ken does not really consider how inaccessible these solutions will be for minorities .

We can change our sources of electricity. That’s easy. We change how we get to work or what we drive. Where it becomes difficult is changing where we live. The houses we buy are all based on personal preference. Mine being simply BIG. Changing the place in which people spend the most time, is not to be taken lightly. THAT is a lot to ask. In addition, telling people what they can and cannot eat is also risky. The lesson that can be taken away is that when people want something they really frickin want it. Unfortunately, I find the “microapartments” rather disgusting. Also it is hard to expect everyone to move to a city.

When he brought up Bloomberg, I was very excited because that is who I am planning on voting for in the election. The adapt NYC plan was interesting and I am sad to say I have never heard of it before. I think an interesting stat brought up was that people in cities often share four meals a week. This is better for the environment I’m sure because they are cooked in community kitchens. 
   <br><br>

The last comment I liked that he made is that civilization inherently creates an issue between humans and nature. I don’t think it will ever be solved.

My personal preference for a home has always been big too. It will certainly be difficult for me to change this preference as it is difficult for me to imagine living in a home roughly the size of a small room. I appreciate the idea of reducing home heating and AC costs, and also believe that these costs will go down substantially if not so many people are living in McMansions greater than 4000 sq ft. It really is hard to expect everyone to move to a city, it is certainly not where I want to live.

   <br><br>

I was planning on voting for Bloomberg as well, so I like that Bloomberg launched the microapartment initiative. Adapt NYC is crucial I think to the future of the city, as its ever growing population can not be sustained by present housing plans. This is also true for our country, as McMansions can not last if our planet is to last.

   <br><br>

As for your last comment, I believe that the issue will be solved, as humans do not really have a choice. We must repair our relationship with nature, so we may live on.

It's outrageous to hear about how big our houses in America are becoming. Other countries, like China that you mentioned, are perfectly fine living in houses that are practical in size, where as many Americans believe bigger is better. There is no need for us to be living in so many huge houses for not only environmentally reasons but also economic reasons. I hope to see changes in the near future where less people are attracted to large homes for the benefit of the environment. I am happy to hear that some places are adapting to this idea and living in co-housing and small housing communities because it really proves that people are taking the climate crisis seriously and taking charge to do what they can to save our future.

Reading a lot of the comments on this video, I've come to see a lot of people who are pledging to make a conscious effort to reduce their carbon footprint and decrease the amount of emissions they are putting into the atmosphere. In this video, Ken also offered a lot of alternatives to the wasteful lives many of us lead to this day. The issue with this though is that these alternatives aren’t necessarily economically inclusive, and many of those who fall outside the middle-upper class range can’t afford to make that type of lifestyle change. This can be related to feeding your children healthy food if you’re low income; sometimes the only options that one can afford are the one dollar menu from McDonald’s and not veggies from a local grocery store if they’re living check to check. Same goes for living eco-friendly. Although I can say with confidence that the majority of the population would like to take steps towards saving the only planet we call home, many don’t have the means to do so economically speaking considering the poverty rate in the United States currently lies at about 14%. 14% of the US population translates into 51 million people who are living on the poverty line. 51 million people carry a large weight when it comes to greenhouse emissions, and it’s hard to make lifestyle changes when you’re doing your best just to stay above ground.

This video surprised me when it described the way living in cities, in co-op housing or smaller housing is actually more beneficial to the environment than living in a huge house in the suburbs. It is crazy to see that 32% of all our CO2 emissions come from just the houses we live in, through the heat and air-conditioning as well as refrigeration and appliances, and by simply sizing down or sharing these utilities with others can make a huge difference. That being said maybe it is selfish to think in this manner, but part of the joy of life is being able to have a nice home, and space to raise a family, not that it needs to be juristically oversized but being able to own a home is a huge motivator to work hard, a lot of people spend years to be able to earn enough money to buy a house and make it a home, and not everyone's ideal situation includes living with others. Not only that but many minorities grow up that way and part of seeking out a better life is seeking ones own space. I feel like there is a balance for everything and you can choose more environmentally friendly environments but some concepts such ass co-op living for the rest of a person's life kills a dream they may have, and may keep people from getting on board the climate crisis train. I feel like their are limitations and a fine line between finding happiness through having little, living simply, and being unhappy because one just does not have enough or can't live comfortably.

It is hard to learn that my everyday life with all the transportation and housing I lived can cause about 86% of the personal carbon footprint. It is also challenging to make changes in life, but after watching so many lectures and videos I decided also to use an electric bike to commute. This is also a healthy way to exercise. Before I often take an Uber to reduce because of the limited time, I often feel myself is rushing to everywhere. However, if I changed to use a bike, I might start earlier than planned, hence I will feel less stressful. If 80 metric tons of CO2 were released when a house is built, I already contributed a lot of the crisis.
   <br><br>

It is the time to think about how to mitigate the issue. From this lecture video, I learned that how modern housing polluted our environment, but live in a city with relatively small living space may reduce pollution. I really enjoy both nature and city blended environment, but there is a little nature in the city right now, the pollution and air quality is still a problem. Thus we need to rethink our relationship with city and add more greens in the urban landscape.

After watching this video, the most surprising fact I found out that was living in a big city can actually be the most effective way to reduce carbon footprint. I also found out a fact that housing is one of the most determined attributions to the greenhouse effect. In the previous video, Ken already mentioned transportation, stuff of minimalism and food. Now it is time to discuss the housing part. Ken has suggested that living in an apartment or sharing an apartment with others can be an effective way to decrease the carbon footprint. In other words, it is a way to support smaller size living. I, personally advocate this kind of living style since it could help our society make a better improvement.

Living nearby NYC for most of my life, I have always been aware of what a different lifestyle cities offer for people. Many live in a small, studio apartment, mostly for financial reasons, do not own a car, and heavily use public transit like the subway. NYC also is very forward thinking when it comes to cuisine, as it is a hub for vegans with new experimental restaurants and pop-ups. Living in a small apartment forces people to own less, and the horrendous traffic and lack of parking spaces makes walking and the subway the easier option for commuting. If subways were everywhere, things would be so easy. You can go all over the city in a matter of minutes for a very cheap price and decrease your carbon footprint. The one issue I see with cities such as NYC or SF is that they are not places people tend to want to live their whole lives. The majority of city folk are single, young adults focusing on their careers. Most people do not want this for their whole life and would prefer to settle down in a suburb to buy a house and start a family. We can't stop people from wanting change like this in their life, but if we could get people to somehow maintain a "settled down" family lifestyle in a big city (which I'm sure many people can do), that would be a step in the right direction for solving the issue with housing contributing to the crisis.

This video, and class in general, has definitely made me think about changes I want to make to my lifestyle. Right now, being a college student, I don’t have a lot of control over my housing situation. My housemates and I try to do what we can to live a more sustainable lifestyle. We use a clothes line instead of a dryer, and have a compost bin in our backward. Most of us eat vegan or vegetarian. I think taking this class had opened my mind to living in a small apartment or “tiny house” later in life. I have actually grown quite fond of community living, and do not have a problem sharing space with others. If I can live in a small house but still have a large yard or access to the outdoors (I plan on having a few dogs!) then I think I would be very content. Back home, I lived in a pretty large house in the suburbs, but most of it went unused. Our guestroom became more of a storage closet and the dinning room is rarely ever used. Knowing it would be more cost efficient and better for the environment, I am very motivated to make changes to my housing situation when I have the power to.

I agree with you. I knew what kind of lifestyle and changes I need to do for my part in reducing climate change. First, change my diet. Because livestock, especially beef, is a big contributor to climate change, I feel like I can not completely go to a plant-based diet so in turn I will consume meats like chicken and implement that with plant-based foods to optimize the best way I could eat. Second, my mode of transportation. Because UCSB mainly requires you to travel on a bike or walk to get to classes, we are already doing what we should do to reduce climate change. This is one of the reason's I admire UCSB. Lastly, living a lifestyle of minimalism. I try to strain away from the consumption of goods and clothes I do want and only purchasing the necessary goods I need, This helps me feel better about how I save my money and it has made me realized that living simply makes me much happier. I also do not have a problem with sharing space with others. I have learned that I would rather save money than spend more money on a single. Right now I am tripling and I do not have a problem with studying because I tend to study at the library and I reflect on how I am saving so much more money rather than having a single.

This week's lecture video actually got me very excited for this bright path forward in respect to urban living. The idea of combining urban life and the natural world to live side by side, is absolutely genius. This would be a perfect way to preserve wilderness and maintain the biodiversity in forests that are continuously affected by human interference and development. The fact that 32% of annual individual emission comes from housing alone  is unacceptable, especially since the majority of this energy use is wasted on things that aren’t necessary whatsoever, such as heating a Mcmansion. Small, urban housing is not only more appealing to someone like me, but it would cut emissions significantly. Additionally the idea of co-housing seems like a completely viable way to live more sustainably while also creating stronger communities. People who crave to live in nature, would still be able to satisfy their wants and needs by bringing nature with them to the city. The solutions are simple: replacing lawns with gardens, using public transportation, implementing community gardens, sharing resources and space, and planting more trees and other natural scenery for both aesthetic reasons and to capture more co2 from the atmosphere. This notion of a “green metropolis” sounds like one of the most important and enticing solutions yet, and I cannot wait to bring these ideas with me wherever I go in the future.

Before watching Ken’s video I would just have assumed that living in the city could be one of the worst things that you could do to the environment because of the pollution from cars, etc., but Ken made very good points of how it is helpful to live in the city. Cities don’t really offer huge places for living so you are most likely going to be staying a small apartment and for transportation there are either lots of buses nearby or even the subway. Although living in the city is a better choice to help the environment, the cost of living in the city can be very high, such as in Los Angeles. Los Angeles is in my opinion one of the most expensive cities to live in. This is why people move to the outskirts of LA or in the suburbs which are a little more affordable than living in the actual city itself. Going off what Ken said though, living in the suburbs seems like it would be more harmful to the environment because you are able to create larger homes and along with that, you are destroying the homes of native animals were already living there.

I don't think a lot of people realize this, but... there are housing co-ops right here in Isla Vista! In fact, I live in one of them. You can actually find co-ops in most places, especially college towns.
   <br><br>
The co-ops I live in aim to provide lower cost housing for low income students in exchange for sharing cooperative duties. Unfortunately, the co-op I live in is not so "low-cost" because of where we live. A typical co-op has multiple bedrooms (averaging around 8) and a shared kitchen and living space. Monday through Friday, one or two people would make dinner for everybody that night. If members are present, they eat together at a large dining table. Everyone in the co-op takes on a job while they live there, for example: maintenance manager, gardener, social manager, secretary, composter etc. One job handles bulk buying for the house. Monthly, members pay a fee that covers food for the house and other basic needs items like toilet paper. Additionally, everyone in the co-op has a weekly chore, and once every quarter, we have a "work holiday" where everyone works together to deep clean the house. And usually co-ops have small gardens that grow vegetables, herbs, and flowers.
   <br><br>
The co-op that I live in is a little bit different than a typical co-op. Instead of a shared living space, my co-op is more like a small apartment complex, with 2-4 people in each apartment. Because of this, we don't have/make communal meals 5 nights a week and we don't include food in our bulk buying. But we do have a potluck once a week! House meetings are every two weeks and we host lots of community events. Because of this, we are still able to build community and friendships between house members. Inter-coop events happen often as well, and co-op residents support the other co-op's events. Some of the co-ops here have themes such as Interfaith, POC, LGBTQ+, vegan etc.
   <br><br>
I encourage everyone to check out the co-ops here at: sbcoop.org and learn more about them. Then... possibly apply to live here over summer or next school year if you are interested! I haven't been living here for long, but I do know I feel at home in my co-op.

-       I think the history of urbanization, city life, and housing is particularly interesting. A long time ago during the urbanization period, people were swarming to cities in mass migrations because it was the next best thing. And now all of the sudden city life is out of style and suburban life is in. But what’s so good about suburban, rural areas? It takes forever to get to work, school, and store. It uses up gas and time. Houses are extremely expensive. We are literally living in rural areas because of the common American culture of “what is right” and what you’re “supposed” to do when you grow up. But WHO CARES!!!! Living in urban cities has many, MANY benefits that people just can ot foresee like being able to walk, bike, or use public transportation to get places. Less time, money, and effort.

I have always thought that living in cities would create more pollution as well as decrease the quality of life in general as the sound and light pollution prevents people from sleeping well and also the pressure of work and social life keeps people very busy. Therefore, living in urban and suburb areas would be much healthier physically and mentally. But I have never considered the environmental differences between urban and rural, like Professor Hiltner said, the government promotes people to live in rural areas because they could enjoy a simpler and a carefree life, and at the same time they could “decrease” their pollution in general. I was quite shocked when the video mentioned that this idea that governments propose was just a propaganda for the increase of consumption of automobiles and not helpful for the environment at all. As a person who has lived in a city for most of his life, there is not really a personal preference between rural and urban areas, but after watching this video, my point of view on cities have changed a lot. I was finally able to get an answer regarding the benefits of living in a city.

I was quite surprised to learn that the best thing to do for the environment is to live in the city. However using common sense states that yes it would lower our carbon footprint as everything is much closer together and we don't have to travel ass far. Many people are moving to different lands like cities and have been greening cities. They are trying to make the city a better, more environmental friendly place which is such a great ideas as we are bringing nature to the city and lowering the carbon dioxide that is produced from the cities below. Protecting the environment is the most important thing that we can focus on in our life times. Despite efforts, the world's time is numbered and odds are will devastate the ecosystems. We are going through our 6th extinction event and are killing huge number of life. we are losing on average 200 species a day and haven't seen such extinction in millions of years. Many people tried to leave the cities and ended up in suburbs which led to a higher carbon foot print and an environmental disaster on a global scale. It is a huge cultural movement that is killing the earth.

I totally agree with you. After watching this lecture video, I had a completely different view of the environmental impact of cities. I lived in Manhattan when I was in high school and lived in Beijing when I was younger. I always thought of cities being super-crowded, noisy, and polluted. However, when it comes to reduce ones carbon footprint, I can’t believe cities could bring so many positive influences. Apartment style housing, which is also called vertical housing, is greatly applied in big cities in order to save land resources. It not only helps reduce the CO2 emissions but also helps people cultivate good consuming habits. Short distances between buildings and buildings encourage people to walk or bike to working places more. The heavy traffic jams and limited parking spots also encourage people to take public transportations like trains and buses. All these choices help mitigate the climate crisis. Hopefully more and more people would be willing to enjoy life in the city, even though some of the urban residents want to escape, but for the sake of the environmental cause, we should learn to adapt.

Knowing that cities are among the most eco-friendly options is a good feeling for me because I've personally always wanted to live in the heart of a city. It's strange to think about that fact though because the imagery that I've learned about growing up concerning cities is usually filled with cars and smog and just a lot of things that emit carbon. It's funny how living there will be a positive impact to climate change now. What I also find interesting is the history of the housing situations in America and how it's changed over the years, more specifically how it has "flip-flopped" from one way to the next. The suburban flights of the twentieth century as people moved from the cities after they had moved into the cities will now maybe become the urban flight of the twenty-first century. I think the movements are based on the situation, and the situation in the twentieth century was one of having the American Dream. Now, it seems that the American Dream has now become one that is unfortunately emitting more carbon than many other things because the idea of success now means living in a suburb with a McMansion. The situation has and will possibly change, and I feel like climate change will be the priority for the coming generation and cause a massive urban flight. Hopefully, the increase of demand for more urban housing will not cause rent to skyrocket even more because I do think that now it's hardly even feasible to pay the expensive rents of living in a studio in San Francisco, New York, etc.

I've always wanted to live in a city, so to know now that they are among the most climate-friendly places to live makes me feel like I have goals that won't contribute to the downfall of the planet. However, cities are also the most expensive places to live in. Going off of a comment  I saw below, charging 2000/month for a bunk bed in SF seems absolutely ridiculous to me. Yes, it's climate-friendly, but people can't be expected to be confined to small spaces like that. I also agree with the top comment, although I wish I didn't. When I drive through Montecito, I find myself longing to have a successful career so I can afford to buy one of the beautiful houses in the hills. Having a successful career so people can afford nice things is something we will never escape- especially since it's been ingrained in our heads since we were born. I think there needs to be a compromise. Not everyone is going to want to live in a tiny home, but we also don't need to live in mansions. We, as a society, need to change what we think about wealth and not clump it in a category with cars and mansions.

I’ve always wanted to live in a city as well. I'm glad that I can still make that happen with a micro apartment. However like Shawnee I have seen the way that popularizing some of the things make rent skyrocket. How are we then supposed to live eco friendly lives? Moreover, I also understand that not a lot of people would want to live that way and still crave that luxurious house. I don't understand how we can convince them otherwise and hope they choose to do co housing when as a society we have been brainwashed into bigger is better.

   <br><br>

I feel like co housing would be a great way to not live alone and be eco friendly but i feel like sometimes you need to have your own space away from people in order to recharge. Co housing makes it a bit difficult as you share everything with everyone. Moving on to eco sabotage, I am glad that activists have moved to eco nurturing as it  seemed like a very bad idea and nurturing areas already occupied by humans seems like a better and more plausible idea.

This week's online lecture really made me rethink a lot about my future housing situation. In the video, professor Ken mentions how American homes are actually getting bigger and bigger, despite the average family size getting smaller. As a result, he suggests that moving to a city would actually be a more sustainable option when it comes to housing. I found this to be interesting because I never really thought about how moving to a big city would actually be helping the environment and help reduce your carbon footprint. This would make sense though since cities are highly invested in public transportation and more efficient apartment housing. This changes my views on big cities, which I always saw as a place for major pollution and the reason for global warming, rather than a place to help reduce it. However, I told myself that I would never live in a big city when I was older and was more attracted to suburban life. I also thought about how many people would most likely not be willing to move to a big city into small apartments, or cohousing accommodations, especially when housing in the city can be so expensive for such little space. With cohousing situations, I feel as though this is not a realistic solution because people will not be willing to share living space since most people will want their own private space. I think that this is an issue that makes this idea so unrealistic. With housing being so expensive and inaccessible, living in the city is simply not an option or the best scenario for most people. This is unfortunate considering that housing and everything surrounding it takes up a huge proportion of your carbon footprint and CO2 gas emissions (around 32%). However, this can call for a change in culture surrounding the size of your home. Rather than having the mentality that “bigger is better”, maybe we can start thinking about housing size as something that should be the most efficient use of space. If we can do this, we can at least begin to reduce the unnecessary space taken up by our homes and use less energy, gas, and others of the sort. Because not everyone can move to the city, it is important to also keep in mind other ways in which we can make our housing more environmentally sustainable and efficient.

After entering this course, we were taught that one of the best ways we can make a contribution in reducing our own carbon footprint is through our housing practices. A subcategory under this suggestion nudged us in the direction that living in cities is a huge factor of benefit, as living in cities tends to promote mass transit transportation methods, bus, or bike. This sort of contradicted some of my perceptions of cities due to previous science classes teaching about how global heat gets trapped under the city where the city insulates, hence, global warming and bad emissions. So it definitely made me question whether city dwelling is good or bad. Ultimately this video does make me see how it is more so good, in that it reduces waste, saves space, and much more in indirect relations to everything else. However, cities still seem to be destroying the idea of nature- elimination of trees. Cities like San Francisco, as I did my research in my Business Administrative Writing course here at UCSB, are making lots of active efforts to make their city more environmentally friendly such as encouraging more bike rentals around the city and stations, increased bus transport and ease, implementing rooftop gardens, putting loads of policies and environmental requirements into place. Housing is a bit more complicated in terms of where to categorize itself as so many factors go into evaluating a place in addition to its environmental impact. I have watched some YouTubers, many of which reside in the city of Los Angeles, and of them, there are a good number of them that do the same thing in coping with the city, bringing plant life within and trying to make their positive contributions. City living is no doubt a tough transition for many people, especially those that came from huge plots of land or ranches, abandoned. The smaller accommodations of apartment size and many other uncomfortable situations were found prominent in reporting the move back into the city, all for the reason of a better planet, to find our humanity back. Again, to wrap up, housing is an interesting topic of choice to choose for reducing carbon footprint, however, its subcategories, again, have all sorts of associations, whether it’s a rooftop garden or a peaceful area surrounded by trees, the positive influence that nature can create is essential to urban life.

I totally agree that cities can still be seen as environmentally unfriendly and destructive to nature. However, since city living is going to become the way of the future, the implementation of naturally occurring nature and parks will make cities just as similar to suburban living. The only time you can be out in complete nature would be to do something similar to Thoreau. City living may be unattractive to many people right now,  but as the years go on many younger generations will hopefully start to take up this way of living.

I have always been torn between my love of cities and nature. I love public transportation and the bustle and diversity of a big city, but I also get very claustrophobic inside of them when I have been cut off from nature for too long. In Japan, the government sanctioned a mental health practice called “shinrin yoku”. This literally translates to “forest bathing”. It is based on scientific and social hypothesis that have been proven saying that being around trees helps both our physical and mental health. Due to these studies, in many cities in Japan there are now new green spots being promoted where people will take breaks off from work to go “forest bathe” — to sit under the trees and simply be around nature. I think this is a good example of combining both city life, which can be so beneficial to the growing human populations, while maintaining a strong relationship with the natural world. I suggest anyone who is interested in the science and studies behind shinrin yoku, search it up!! You'd be amazed at the information you find on it.
   <br><br>

Another thing I saw brought up amongst the comments is that this “small scale” lifestyle is mainly exemplified for middle and upper class people. I think this is an important issue because it hits home for so many who have had less and not by choice. I think that it does make sense to target the message of small scale living at the upper classes mainly because they are the ones emitting the most, but I also think that we need to be sure to include all classes into these messages. Someone once told me that the best way to teach sustainability was to build on the things that people already did in their day-to-day lives. While it is not something I live by mainly because I think more needs to change, I think it’s a good place to start when we talk about sustainable living. Promoting reusing and urban gardens are things that can both be cost efficient and can better your living environment along with your ecological footprint. In our society, we’ve been convinced that we need more. It’s hard to escape that mentality from the bottom because it seems like you’ve never really had enough. How can you not want more when you feel like you’re barely holding on as it is? I think this is where the focus needs to shift. Yes, we are talking about material items, but what is the implicit value that goes with this? I think we need to replace the want of material things with the want of better relationships and a happier life. Happiness that does not come from material. Even coming from a lower class family, I still know that I had more growing up than others. That being so, I cannot speak as if I truly know what it is like. All I know is that if we can build a society where people care more about each other and the Earth than they do about material items and greed, then maybe we can all be a little closer happiness throughout the classes and our social structures.

After watching this week’s mini-lecture, I’m totally stunned by the fact that one of the most effective ways to reduce one’s carbon footprint is to move to a big city. When I first heard that, I thought of good effects like bringing the GDPs up and replenishing industrial activities with the free labor force. Then I saw the negative part of that: housing space might decrease, transportation will be busy, and all kinds of waste might increase. These are all factors attributing to the climate crisis and it might make our situation worse, in which I felt a little pessimistic about it. As the lecture goes on, though, it starts to change my perspective. Ken suggests that the method of co-housing with others in apartments and sharing daily household facilities and living space with others could really lead to a decrease in our carbon footprints and this is the one that I’m going to use when I become a sophomore next year. To me, this is an essential part of my plan for reducing my carbon footprints.

Yes! The Best Way for People to reduce carbon print is to move a large city. Because we will have a large probability of not having a car, and have a smaller house. It is really a stunning fact for me as well. however, I would still choose to live in the country side or rural areas such as places like UCSB, it can make me feel closer to the nature and to feel the real self just like Peter mentioned in his film this week.

While the inclusion of the blend of both Urban and Rural lifestyle was refreshing and interesting to learn about, I'm still unconvinced that moving to a city is a viable solution to preach. Suggesting that everyone move to a city is the essentially promoting mass migration to already overpopulated, crumbling, underfunded cities and hoping that it happens quick enough to prevent sea level rise. This would require a mass reallocation of resources, as well as time to completely revamp and add on to existing infrastructure. This window is extremely small, if not already gone, and could possibly leave us in a situation where large portions of the population are concentrated in cities where there is a high risk of them being destroyed or rendered unlivable by rising sea levels. Building new cities in the middle of the country could be a solution, but again, how long would that realistically take?
   <br><br>

Another problem I see is that high crime rates correlate with poverty and high population density, two problems that plague many American cities. Adding even more people to the mix could potentially make life terrible for a lot of people, especially for poor people and minorities. I get that sacrifices need to be made in order to solve the climate crisis, but subjecting people to this kind of lifestyle is not the way I want to go about it. Pushing people towards cities will have a large impact, but is it feasible? Not really.

Since the houses are built and impossibly getting demolished, I think it’s really cool to see what we can do on these built houses to mitigate the effect the green house gas emission causes. Also, I think it’s a great move to build those “green metropolis”, because once these big cities start to build the city green, smaller cities will soon follow up, and, eventually, green will become a theme of all cities. Moreover, I also agree on the idea that we don't need big houses and a big house doesn’t meaning anything. To me, as long as a house meets my basic needs, it’s good enough. Last but not least, the idea of co-housing sounds really intriguing to me. Being a person who likes to live with friends under the same roof, I think co-housing would be a perfect fit for me, and the fact that co-living can also help mitigate green house gas emission definitely firm my wish of co-housing with my friends next year.

We know by now that smaller housing in big cities is the best thing for the environment when regarding living concerns. This however sounds problematic to me as there is so many suburbs and space that are not the big cities. What would we do with all the development in those places and there is no way that large cities could actually hold all of the population in the US. Another thing that was brought up in coop living spaces is that I find it hard to believe that everyone could be happy living like that. This goes back to the film of this week that people should find ways to be happy and fulfilled while doing good deeds such as helping the environment. And this proposal just does not seem to cover that. I personally would not mind living in a city but I can think of many people who would prefer a less busy environment but one thing I would like in the future is my own house or apartment. Co-housing communities might be better for the environment and are possible, but I think I value my personal space and freedom too much to have that much space be a shared space.

After watching the lecture video “House and Cities”, I felt housing is one of the most important origin of greenhouse gas emission. In the lecture video, Ken mentioned that housing, transportation, stuff, and food are four main personal carbon footprint. We have already talked about the transportation, the stuff and minimalism, and the food. So it is time to talk about the housing issue. The trend that the average US house size is increasing is related to people’s strong wants. They want bigger space and more things to fill into the house. I think the main reason is from the advertisements and some animation. They try to announce that a successful person or a rich person should own a big house or a mansion to show their social status. As a result, most of people think house is a very important thing. But bigger house means heavier burden on the planet. How to make people change their idea that bigger house do not mean anything is a question for climate activists. Climate change is still a cultural issue.

It is kind of interesting that the suggestion to reduce carbon footprint is to move to the city. The first impression of city for most people is modern and flourishing, which is the place have most carbon emission. However, living in the city can reduce the distance for commuting from home to the working place. At the same time, the crowd city forces the house size become smaller. To sum up, living in the city really helps the transportation and housing problem, which is a wise choice.

In this lecture, Ken talks about how housing contributes to our carbon footprint and what we must do to change that. Ken suggests that “we” live in smaller houses instead of big houses or mansions. Due to that advice, I cannot relate to this lecture. For all 18 years of my life I have lived in the same small two-bedroom apartment. Therefore, I would say my carbon footprint is pretty small when it comes to housing. Anyways, I agree that people that own big houses should move into smaller ones, but that does raise a few questions and problems. What would happen to all the big houses that are left alone? Also, in order to get all these people into smaller houses we would have to build more small homes, which would of course lead to some carbon output. I know Ken just wants to help, but he should definitely dive more into it and address these type of things.

I really like the idea of co-housing. As mentioned by the video, modern day Americans have gradually increased the size of their homes into not only environmentally destructive but also impractical sizes. The carbon footprint of the present houses is enormous and if the dream homes of every individual was realized, the consequences are incomprehensible to me. Therefore, I think it’s highly important for Americans to embrace or at least see the benefits that may come with co-housing. In addition of the drastically reduced carbon footprint, co-housing provides social elements not currently typical in present day homes. Living in a big home can be isolating and I see many houses that hinder engagement with one’s community. Co-housing could prevent that prevalent sense of isolation and allow an medium for communal engagement typical in other counties like Denmark.

The unlikely comparison between moving to cities and Thoreau was an interesting perspective on the rise of urbanization. Although Thoreau moved to a region that was quite the opposite of a city, the basis of the move is the same concept behind moving to cities for a positive environmental impact. Just like Thoreau, we as society should move to a simpler lifestyle, and this can be achieved through "urban simplicity" as compared to Thoreau's "wilderness simplicity".  Ken also mentions some popular movements that actually take action on this - such as Adapt NYC. It is pretty cool to see how Thoreau's fundamental beliefs are still being practiced at scale today, just in a different way.

Although Ken does a solid job of establishing the problem of housing and explaining the solution of urbanization in trying to solve it, I felt that there was a lack of realism in this video. The unfortunate reality is that it is very difficult to try to move the majority of the world's population to cities without finding a revolutionary alternate to jobs and resource allocation. For example, in the U.S., people across the mid-west are dependent on industrialization and agriculture jobs. It is unrealistic to try to convince these people to move to cities as their lives and work revolve around things that are difficult to bring to a city. However, I do agree that the process of mass urbanization is a culture shift that will have to be ingrained in the mindsets of future generations.

I was surprised to find out that 17% of the gas emissions  are from simply heating and cooling the house. I agree with Ken that I think todays’society has encouraged wanting the biggest or newest items. Which has caused people to want bigger homes and  has caused a lot more gas emissions from making a house. I wasn’t surprised to hear that a car is 4 times as bad as the construction of an average home simply because cars are used a lot more at a short period of time. It is interesting the fact that King mentions that living in the cities is better since there is less driving meaning less greenhouse gas emission and housing is smaller due to the lack of space. 
   <br><br>
I knew a lot of people lived in cities but I was unaware that it was at such a high number, being 55%. I am curious how we would change the living styles for so many people by urbanzing living.  It's interesting to think that for urbanization sometimes industries would clear the land of important features such as trees which are important for our environment.

This is really hits home because housing is kinda of a problem here in California. And the easiest way to combat this problem is through a combination of building more homes and rent control. And the building more housing could be a little problematic because we really need to take into consideration the materials used to make these houses and the size of the houses. Knowing California I don’t think building small houses are gonna cut it here. One the things that I’ve found interested is renovating abandoned buildings for another purpose. One of my siblings used to live in a small apartment in an apartment complex that used to be a nursing home. I think we should be doing more of this around the world. I also think we should change the definition of what we consider to be a home. You know living in this grande house is completely unnecessary  and a lifestyle like that is detrimental to the planet. Living in small and compact houses should not be looked down upon but encouraged.

I thought it was very interesting that this week's lecture recommended me to move to the city to reduce my carbon footprint. I lived in a suburban area that is around 10 minutes away from Sacramento for most of my life and always viewed the city as an area that was usually not environmentally friendly. Therefore, I did not expect this video to explain how moving to the city may actually reduce my carbon footprint in comparison to continuing to live in the suburbs. However, it all made more sense as I watched the video since Ken explained how cities have a better public transportation system in addition to a smaller living space. My life here in Santa Barbara is definitely different from my life back home. Although Santa Barbara is not a big city compared to San Francisco and Los Angeles, I do recognize the benefits of living in the city that I did not realize before. The public transportation system in Santa Barbara is better than that of my hometown. Therefore, I ride the bus to get to my destination instead of using a car. In addition, I share an apartment with five other people. After experiencing a glimpse of what living life in the city may be like, I will definitely consider moving to the city after graduation to help reduce my carbon footprint.

It is crazy to think that the notion to moving to a city can be an effective way to change the overuse of your carbon emissions. Figuring that most cities emit mass amounts of carbon, like Tien mentions this is odd to think as I grew up in the same type of setting described. Realizing that living in smaller homes with more people does make me realize that we as UCSB students are acting in that way without even knowing due to the expensive rent for these beautiful beach side estates. The housing situation in Isla Vista is something unseen I believe anywhere in other college towns as my friends from other schools can’t believe our living situations. The fact that we pack five people into one room of a house filled with twenty people demonstrates we are utilizing our space efficiently, reducing our carbon footprint evidently. I agree that we need to turn our attention to the cities and industries we’ve built because we can essentially turn these mass emission producers into climate activist housing and living for all types of people.

I recently read an article on Medium entitled “The Future of Housing May Be $2,000 Dorm Rooms for Grownups.” It’s about the rise of new housing developments in San Francisco and throughout silicon valley that focus on micro apartments and co-living arrangements, with many bedrooms sharing a common kitchen and bathroom. The title of the article made me want to slam my head against a wall. As Ken explained in this lecture, one of the most sustainable ways to live in a modern city is to live in a micro apartment or in co-housing situations. They reduce energy consumption, other resource consumption, and by living in cities with better public transportation and more places within walking distance, travel emissions are reduced as well. Yet for most people in the US, a 2500 sqft home in the suburbs is considered “the American dream,” and not many people would be willing to give that lifestyle up to live in an apartment, much less a tiny apartment, or crazier, an apartment that you share with strangers. So to see this headline reinforcing an aversion to sustainable housing was really disappointing. As someone quite literally living in a dorm room at the moment, now that I’ve gotten used to it, I would seriously consider living in a micro apartment or co-housing in the future. I mean, the 200-400 sqft average of those places will probably seem roomy to the 100 sqft I share with a semi-stranger right now. I hope that more people will come around to the benefits of a lifestyle in the city, and be able to detach from the idea that a suburban lifestyle should be the norm.

I've grown up with the idea of the American Dream in mind- to get a good job, a family, and work hard to earn the "best" things in life like a nice car and home. Taking in all of the horrid environmental effects of those things over the course of Ken's class has been quite literally dream-crushing. Similarly to you, I came to college and have gotten used to living in a tiny dorm room, and would consider a 200-400 square foot microapartment quite spacious. I could easily see living in a place like that during college, graduate school, and maybe for a bit after that but then like many I feel I would tire of it. I would like to see microhousing become the social norm for all ages, but I don't necessarily see it happening due to such reinforced ideas of what getting older in America implies relative to housing, and I suppose that is disappointingly represented in the article title you presented. I want to do this and I want other people to do this, but the question is how to convince enough people to create a true mass movement.

After watching the video, it was kind of hard to hear that one of the best ways to reduce one's climate footprint was to move to a city. I have lived in the Central Valley my whole life, and besides Fresno, there basically no city life anywhere. In fact, moving here to Santa Barbara was an entirely new experience into the world of living in a city. My whole life has been surrounded by farming and the country, and after learning more about it, its heartbreaking that my impact on the world is so much less if that I lived in a city. Also, if everyone were to relocate into major cities, I feel that the massive influx of cultures, social classes, and people would create many issues, or even fuel the issues that major cities also deal with already, such as discrimination. While Ken's videos seem to be informative and hopeful for the future, I sense that these claims are 'too good to be true' and would create much more problems than solutions.

I have started visiting the Central Valley often after starting a relationship with someone who grew up there, and my experiences of wildly different American living places can be frustrating for me - My experiences in more populous areas have been marked by less pollution, yes, but also more stress, less sleep, and more secondhand smoke. I thought it was interesting that Ken mentioned how big movements are happening in urban and suburban farming - in Bakersfield, I've almost never seen a small yard/local farm, while my house in the bay area if flanked by two. San Francisco is maybe somewhere in the middle.

<br><Br>
I want to see a green city, but I mostly see grey, and that is depressing - I also think Ken's vision may be a little optimistic. I hope city living can begin to look more possible as a long term option, but in the meantime, I hope to find ways i can downsize and deeply enjoy the living spaces that I already have.


<br><Hr>
I agree with you in that on a larger scale simply having everyone moving into tighter cities is definitely not a feasible solution. As you mentioned cultures will clash discrimination may occur, tensions may arise, and an increase in overall daily stress is a possibility as well. But I am still hopeful that this may still be an effective method if it persuades people who have contemplated the idea of moving to the city to do so so that society/and the planet can benefit from the reduction of greenhouse gases and their more sustainable minimal living. Living farther out in the country is sadly worse off for the environment, however, I wonder if these downfalls of living farther out can be eliminated through different practices of environmentally friendly living such as using solar panels and using electric vehicles to travel to and from the city when need be. But in the end, everyone is going to have to make some type of sacrifice in their current living behavior in order to be living an environmentally conscious society. Cities may be the future for living in a climatarian society, we will just have to wait and see.
<br><Hr>
I can totally relate to this. Before this class my idea of a green lifestyle was the life of someone out in nature living surrounded by land. My grandparents raised sheep and my community was spread far apart by ranches and farms so it took a long time to drive from one end to the other. I. had never considered just how much driving I did at hone in comparison to life in Los Angeles for example. A day out with friends would consist of driving back and forth across town four times or more: picking everyone up, going across to. the mall and then back to the movies and then back to dinner and then back to the coffee shop. On weekends kids would use more gas to drive into LA or up toward the beach, or drive down through Acton to go out into the desert. The amount of gas alone could be enough to convince me of the potential ecological fallout of suburban living. The other thing I really liked about this comment was your point about the issues that might form from the majority of people being relocated to the city. It's interesting to discuss how that program would be implemented so that public opinion would be positive. To begin with, cities would have to massively restructure their infrastructure to a) fix problems like low quality housing and restore old buildings b) replace the old infrastructure with a new greener one and c) SOMEHOW address the systematic inequality of our housing system as it pertains to people of color vs white people. Without addressing these three problems, I feel like the movement toward urban centers will be obsolete.

This lecture opened my eyes to the devastation caused by societies values in owning large amounts of property. It is pretty shocking to me to find that other cultures outside of western influence do not have the same values in large houses as we Americans do. Most people I know, including I, see owning a large house as being successful. This notion that society pushes on us is rather irrational, as one can get by quite happily in a small living space. This lecture goes back to the ideas of minimalism. I've come to the realization that owning a lot of things does not necessarily equate to happiness. There is a certain happiness in being free through not being tied down by so many belongings. It is not a necessity to hoard all these resources. If this mindset can be changed throughout the world, especially here in america, I truly believe that overall happiness, bodily health, and the health of the planet would drastically improve. Instead of basing our happiness and values on hollow objects, we as a society should encourage a more sustainable lifestyle.

Honestly, several of the points brought up in this video sound appealing on multiple levels. Living in smaller housing, growing your own vegetables, and sharing with the community, all of those seem like favorable lifestyle choices. If I set my goals smaller and choose to live in smaller housing then that brings the cost of living down significantly, making my lifestyle much more comfortable and less stressful than if I chose to aim high and own a big house and two cars. Choosing to grow produce in your backyard encourages eating healthier organic products over the produce sold in stores, which most likely contains many pesticides and chemicals just due to the logistics of large scale farming. Furthermore, sharing resources with the community helps foster relationships and introduces variety to your life, as instead of being limited solely to the products grown in your backyard, you get to share with the people around you and they in turn share with you. All of these would help maintain your mental well-being and possibly even bring peace to the mind. Whenever I do go out and start living in the world, I would like to consider all of these options for myself, and I encourage others to do so as well, instead of just adhering to the norm that we must all be individualistic and as successful as possible. Sometimes, smaller is just better.

I fear that city life is a little bit more variant than proposed in this lecture. Take Wiesbaden, Germany, for example. On one side of the city, there are absolutely beautiful homes, wonderful little parks, nice bakeries, and an overall quaint vibe. Take a few blocks to the east part of town, and you have a full other story. Half the street lights are broken, the houses are all run down and half abandoned, trash skirts around the sidewalks, and the last word you'd describe it with is quaint. Thats why I think there would be a problem with a bunch of people moving into a city. The overall gentrification of areas developed from an influx of people could push more people into the worse off sides of town. While ideally we could all share a variety of similar houses and produce similar amounts of CO2, this is not the current case. Wealth gaps can mirror carbon emission gaps, as the wealthier sides of a city still have nice cars, expensive clothes, consumer stores, etc, while the poorer areas are a lot less flamboyant in their presentation.

Moving to a city may reduce our carbon footprint in the sense that the housing is smaller, and it is still possible to live sustainably there with gardens and such. However, telling people to live this more environmentally friendly lifestyle implies that anyone has enough money to do so. The cities mentioned in this video are extremely expensive, and it is not financially feasible for just anyone to live there. Not only is the housing expensive, the cost of living in general is more expensive when it comes to most products. Additionally, in general there are many environmentally friendly actions that do not fit the budget of the lower class. My friend had mentioned that her dad had gotten solar panels installed in his house, and it has ended up costing more money because rather than charging for the amount of electricity he uses (which is for the house of one man), it charges him for the maximum amount of energy that it COULD be used for, which is significantly higher than the amount he actually uses. For someone who is more well off and can spare the money, this is fine, but for someone who is living paycheck to paycheck and cannot afford to waste the extra money. 

   <br><br>

In general, I support the ideas being brought up in these videos, and I am lucky enough to be financially stable enough to be able to follow these ideas when the time comes. However, we cannot assume that these ideas are something that just anybody can decide to pursue.

For me, living in a relatively small house doesn't seem like much of a problem. I think even for people who accumulate a lot of wealth that they never experienced before, it shouldn't be difficult to refrain from buying a big house or mansion. It's all about the mindset. You can work to get money with the goal of getting more and more material things, or you can work to acquire wealth with the goal of being financially stable. If someone is living paycheck to paycheck, while working as hard as they can to provide the basic necessities for their family, why can't they just be happy with the luxury of not having to worry about money like they did before once the acquire wealth? I understand treating yourself every once in a while for working hard, but there's a difference between having enough and being excessive.

I found this lecture particularly interesting because it had me reflecting on my life back home. I’ve lived in a city my whole life, and noticed that it’s more common to live in an apartment than living in a large house with less than 5 people living in it. However, in my culture it is normal for the son to continue living at home even after they get married. So, I grew up in a home with my grandparents, my uncle and his family along with my parents and siblings. This meant that my house was pretty large. I wonder what Ken would have to say about this way of living. I’m curious to know how much harm this is causing compared to if we all split up and decided to live in seperate apartment units. Another point that I was curious about was the idea of living in a city and how that allows for increased likelihood of using public transport. I understand that when Ken talks about these ideas, he is typically referring to other parts of the States or Europe. I have been waiting for him to promote discussions about other parts of the world, Asia in particular. Thailand, for example, is a city in which biking and walking don’t seem to be a fit because of many different factors. A lot of people also use motorcycle taxis, and it would be helpful to know how this is impacting the planet. I think it’s great that Ken talks about cities in which they are able to promote biking, but what about other less developed countries, where it would be harder to implement? How can we start to make changes in those regions? What about countries that have a struggling government? I understand that the States are a major contributor to the climate crisis, but it would still be interesting to see how changes can be implement in different parts of the world.

Something Ken made me think about is what we should do about existing houses that are already build. Should just move into micro apartments and leave those other houses behind? or should we be more conservative and simple only use those house if we need the room for large families? This made think if we should just use the resources we have existing, rather than wasting them or leaving them in the dust. I guess one remedy is Co-housing that Ken brought up earlier. Just make those existing houses into co-houses. To be honest, I quite like the idea of living in a tiny home. It is quite weird to think that living in cities is quite green. I never would of assumed that these large massive housing communities of people, is better for the environment then lets say, living in the wilderness or something. I guess this goes to show how little we know about being environmentally green. Something i wonder is how simple eco friendly urban cities would look like because when i think of city, i imagine San Francisco or New York. Maybe we just how to redefine what a city is.

I am all for the micro-apartments in major cities because I think it is a great way to reduce our carbon footprint. This new movement or way of thinking when it comes to minimizing our carbon footprint is exciting because you don't typically think of cities as being environmentally friendly. When we think of big cities like New York, San Francisco or Los Angeles, we tend to think of cars, overpopulation, big corporations and factories. It should be pretty obvious by now that it is impossible to get rid of these huge corporations and factories because of how deeply embedded these things are in our culture and economy. However, this new trend towards city living will actually help reduce carbon emissions because major cities are developing better bike paths (thus reducing the need and appeal of driving a personal car) to encourage people to walk or bike to work, and more efficient housing (since there is no space for huge mansions for each family). I found it very interesting to learn that cities are implementing and encouraging new environmental concepts like bringing nature to the city with things like rooftop gardens and backyard chicken coops. The idea of a "green metropolis" fascinates me because of its seemingly counterintuitive and contradictory notion, yet it is anything but that. If we want to save the planet, we need to bolster new ways to reduce our carbon footprint that will be appealing to everyone.

I think micro apartment is really a great idea since living in a small apartment means less clean time which is convenient, and it forces you to possess less stuff, which can effectively reduce one’s carbon footprint. It is astonishing that 17% of the average Americans carbon footprint comes from heating and cooling our homes and in addition 15% comes from other energy related uses in the home such as lighting, as mentioned in the video. City living can shorten the commute time, and by taking public transportation or biking, people would use less fossil fuels.

 I completely agree with you! I think in terms of city life, I think integrating micro apartments is a great idea. If I remember correctly, I think Ken mentioned in a lecture about how around 70%-75% of the entire population with be living in cities by 2050. Which means there has to be space to accommodate such an influx of people moving into cities. Which is why I believe micro apartments are so great, like you said, they force you to reduce your belongings. I can't help but connect this idea to our past lecture about minimalism and Henry David Thoreau. Reducing our belongings in turn reduces our carbon footprint. Moreover, I think the addition of micro apartments would eliminate the need to travel long distances in order to visit a friend or family member. Since they are so small, distance between micro apartment to micro apartment is decreased, bringing everyone closer.
 <br><hr>
 After listening to Ken’s lecture on housing and cities, my perspective on the way we live changed. While his lecture lists off a few possible solutions, there is not one standard house and standard usage of energy to base these ideas off of. Cutting emissions is possible but it must be done a certain way as there is no way we can force people to move to the cities or live in Co-housing. Placing certain caps based on factors such as house size, household size, and amount of energy and water usage, provides a potential way to monitor annual carbon emissions. If we were to potentially add an additional cost or fee for going over a said monthly allotted energy amount, it would force people to become more consciously aware of their energy usage. This cap could be based on a family by family basis and provide an incentive to people who switch to more renewable energy sources. By changing even something as simple as your light bulbs to a more energy efficient one or having motion sensored lights that turn on and off for you when you leave a room could save such a large amount of energy. This is a feasible solution as many people have already made the switch to more energy efficient light bulbs as they are better for the environment. If people commit to switching to more renewable energy sources, then our emissions from this aspect of lifestyle will be decreased dramatically as we are already over 2.5 times our allotted energy budget.

In the lecture “Housing and Cities”, we are introduced to a housing system that is environmental-friendly. It is said that living in micro apartment in the urban will help reduce carbon emission. I am happy to see that because it has been my dream to live in an micro-apartment where every piece of furniture is well-organized which give me a sense of fulfillment. This is not only moral but also affordable for young people like me and hence I highly recommend that to most of the young generation.

I would imagine that it's actually going to feel delight to have a micro apartment that is impact, organized, creative. I am always a person poor at space managements, I usually tend to create a lot of mess with a large space as it barely concerns me in my daily life. Living in a smaller space should force me to learn where to put stuffs to conserve space and avoid chaos. It gives me less excuses and options of buying more unnecessary stuffs to fill the excess space, and hell it's even fun to have some small but well-thought objects or decorations around. Right now I am living in a relatively small apartment with a roommate, it's rented so I can't do much changes about it, but micro apartment is definitely worth trying in the future.

I actually find it super interesting that urban lifestyles are often some of the very for helping mitigate carbon footprints. I always thought that city living was atrocious for the environment, but after watching Ken's video, I now understand why it makes sense for it to actually be more beneficial. City living relies much more on public transport or walking because of how close together buildings are to each other; housing is more compact, so you buy less "extras"; etc. I grew up in a weird "sort of city, but also kind of rural" area where pretty much every family owns at least 1 car, but oftentimes more, and where we have very little true city space. Housing and work locations are very, very spread out, so commuting is an absolute must to get the things you need or go to where you need to go. This amount of car usage just rubs more salt into the visibly open wound of air pollution that we already get from large cities, and the amount of farming and livestock maintenance that also occurs in the area only exacerbates it. I think most people view rural areas as being "kinder" to the earth because they would seemingly understand better than others that in order for humans to benefit from the earth, we have to take care of it; alas, that isn't the case, as per my personal experience in my hometown. 
   <br><br>

The thing about switching towns to being much more urban is the fact that many regions simply cannot sustain an urban environment within them, and people will be far too stubborn and unwilling to move to new urban areas if they've lived their whole lives outside a cityscape. Cities can appealing for a lot of people in a very short timespan, but it's much harder to make them appealing for a long period of time; people just don't always like a fast-paced lifestyle, or not having more living space, or not having to rely on their own personal vehicles, etc. It will probably be a long time before America would be able to maneuver completely to city living.

Living in a city is something I had never really considered before taking this class. I grew up in a suburb, and it always seemed like a nice place to be in and to raise a family in. I considered cities chaotic and thought living in an apartment would be too confining. Now I am starting to see the benefits of living in a city, such as being able to bike to work. The benefits of city living are especially apparent now that I am living for the first time in a dorm, sharing communal spaces with others. I thought it would be a bigger deal than it was to have to live in such a small space and share amenities with others, but it wasn't as hard as I thought. Sharing my room with others also made me realize how much unnecessary stuff I had. When I was packing for college I had to leave a lot of my things in my room at home, and I wondered how I would be able to live with fewer things. Now I realize that all of the things I left at home were rarely, if ever, needed and that I had a lot of unnecessary stuff I could do without. Another benefit of living in a college dorm is that I can bike or walk to almost any place I need to get to, which would also likely be true in a city. While I will occasionally need to go to places too far to bike, it is pretty easy for me to use the bus, which would also likely be true in a city where public transportation tends to be a little more accessible than in the suburbs. While I do think that adjusting for city living could be hard for me due to the chaos and the noise, it is something I am now seriously considering once I finish college because of the environmental benefits.

I completely agree with you. Before starting college, I thought living and sharing a tiny room with two other people would be so difficult and cause many problems or discomfort in my life. After living in the dorms for a couple of months, I can say that it really isn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be. It made me realize that I actually really like sharing a smaller space because I don't have as much stuff to worry about. I have less closet space, so I too only brought a small amount of clothes, which makes it a lot easier and less stressful for me to clean my space from time to time. I thought not having a car here would be difficult, but it is really not the case at all. I can walk to my classes, the dining commons, the various food location we have here on campus, the market, etc. I can also take the bus to downtown or any other store if I ever need amusement or groceries. I love how much my carbon footprint has decreased because of all of this. Living here has definitely opened my eyes to the possibility of living in a city setting with roommates in the future.

I agree with you, living in a city is something I never really considered being environmentally friendly. I lived in a very big city for my whole life and always thought that I was not contributing in any positive way to the environment by living in a city. I did take the metro sometimes and I tried to bike whenever I could, but honestly, even if I lived in maybe one of the most urban places, I just don’t see it as being a more eco-friendly place than a rural countryside farm house. Maybe this is because Dubai is extremely lavish and extravagant and over the top, or maybe it’s just a big city that is extremely spread out, so everything cannot be compact into a small area that you can simply bicycle around. First of all, my dad would never let me bike outside my neighborhood, because to be frank I have not seen a single bike track in the city I grew up in my entire life, and thus there's no way of me getting to places by bike, if i'm being realistic. 
   <br><br>

Something I found extremely interesting was the Paris Promenade Plantée, It’s so beautiful and an amazing form of artistic, social, political, and scientific expression that shows the world that nature and cities and nature and technology do not have to b4 separated into such disparate categories. This new wave of environmental activists are extremely smart, greening cities making beautiful works of art for people to see and visualize how beautiful their backyards and front yards can look like if they invest in the improvement of their gardening tools and abilities. One thing I had never heard about it was David Owen’s expression of eco-sabotage. This is when thwarting and checking human encroachment into wilderness is being supplemented by the eco-nurturing of areas that are already developed. This is an extremely interesting movement that I think many of us can carry out.

Hi, I completely agree with your statement about the benefits of living in the city. I think that city living can be the centers of culture and modification and it has the power to change the world. Although they have a terrible appetite for carbon emissions, they are just as vulnerable as they are as they are powerful. UCSB has allowed me to experience co-housing and I like it. It reduces carbon footprint from each household by a lot and I feel that when you live with other people, they force you to be considerate for others. Although co-housing in the future is likely for me, I think other people may find this idea hard because they can't live with others and would like privacy.

<br><hr>
I can relate to you on the part about owning an unnecessary amount of things and clothing. I have found it easier in the past years to have less and be attached to less. There are so many things nowadays that people "need" to have to survive day to day. People are so used to growing up and buying a house in a nice suburb away from all the commotion. We need to reverse those notions and have more benefits of living in cities for people. I can think of many personal and environmental benefits on end, but city governments need to help with concerns of other people like crime and population density. 
   <br><br>
I think the concerns of housing and city life also goes hand in hand with the documentary we watched. So many Americans focus their happiness in things that inevitably won't matter instead of embedding happiness into simple actions and personal items with emotional significance.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with you. When I was very little my family and I lived in a more rural suburb, growing our own chickens and doing compost. Although we were doing some things right, it led to the negative consequence of my family owning a bigger home because we could afford it. I pictured that lifestyle as sort of perfect. Nice home, huge backyard and all the stuff I could want to fill that huge home. Now, I know it was far from it. Besides all of the obvious materialistic negative consequences of that lifestyle, there was another problem; traffic. The commute from my home to my school and my parents work was around 45 minutes plus traffic. This was a daily commute, by car. Looking back, our carbon footprint must have been massive, even more considering my dad owned a mustang and my mom a jeep which are two very gas inefficient cars.

   <br><br>

Eventually, we moved to the city, closer to the beach. This was certainly a change, new school, new friends etc... Even then I can tell you that I would never go back to the suburbs. Even though we still commuted by car, our daily commute dropped to only around 10 minutes for my school, and everything else in walking distance. Essentially I gained two hours of my life, each day. I was used to leaving home at sunrise and coming back after dark, but when we moved all of the sudden I had daylight to go to the park or play soccer or go to the movies or do anything other than be stuck in traffic. The biggest change for me however, was having stuff at walking distance. It gave me freedom, there was a small shopping mall close by with a sandwich and ice cream shop I would walk to with friends after school. Like you don't understand how big of a deal that was for eleven year old me. I could go somewhere WITHOUT my parents, it was truly freeing. 

<br><hr>

All in all, i'm just saying, give cities a try. You don't have to go full on New York in order to achieve a sustainable lifestyle. Find a city that suits your needs and where you can picture yourself. Now, my family lives in Oceanside San Diego. It is a small beach town with everything in walking distance and one of the most beautiful downtown cities (San Diego) just a 30min train ride away. Having lived there for the past three years, there are still some changes I'd like to do to my lifestyle but Its pretty close to my idea of perfection.
<br><hr>
I agree with this comment. I lived in a decently large house growing up out in the country. Meaning we had our own well, electricity, plumbing and all of that. I can see how living in a big city would be better for the environment because all of those things would be combined instead of having individual systems for each apartment. Living out in the country we also used a lot of gasoline. It was at least a 20-minute drive to school for both me and my sister and a 10-minute drive to work for each of my parents. Living in the city, you would probably be close enough to either bike or walk to work or take the subway. 
<br><hr>
I also agree with what you said and about living in the dorms. From my room at home I maybe took half of my things and I still didn't use half of the stuff I brought to college. It showed me how many of the things I have are really useless and probably a result of consumerism.

My family built our own house. We (well not myself so much as I was three at the time) went out into the middle of nowhere, cleared out all the foliage, blackberry bushes, and trees we deemed necessary to build it. My house isn't massive, but it likely could be considered larger than an average home (I'm uncertain of the measurements). It's a fair size and unsurprisingly, we don't even use a huge portion of the home, that being our basement. My house is two floors, the basement having the same coverage as the upper level which consists of two bathrooms, a living room, a kitchen, a dining room, my bedroom, my brother's bedroom, and my parent's bedroom. My basement poses for storage, which seems like an effective use of space, but then we must consider that all of those items are clearly unimportant and unused, simply taking up room. In short, a four person--or more accurately three person as I'm now in college--family does not require this much room. Not to mention the approximated 80 metric tons that went into creating this beast. There's a lot of carbon just festering in the walls of my home that's just so overwhelmingly unneeded. 

   <br><br>

As I mentioned, I love my home. It's where I grew up after all, and while clearly not very healthy, having built this place all on our own does create even more attachment. Unlike other things we can change, at least I can say it having been built is said and done, there's nothing we can do to mitigate that process and so I don't have to remain guilty that it stands. I do have the feel bad about it being there, but I can feel bad about the electricity and heating and all those other things that are just building up day by day. I love and cherish my home, but the concept of a tiny house or even co-housing is rather alluring. Might be too much information, but I have intention of remaining on my own for the entirety of my life, ie. no spouse or children, so having a home where I have neighbors to keep me company seems really nice and less isolating. Or even just living in an adorable house, perhaps with potential to move about and see the world is also so incredibly nice. I think these lifestyles should be more common in the U.S. I've never even understood the appeal of living in a huge empty house. I really can only hope that it becomes trendy to be in a small home, because what's not to love?

I enjoyed how detailed the this was, and various topics covered are helpful to people with different lifestyles.
   <br><br>
This reading was definitely different from the usual readings for the class. It was more of an informative list, and I really appreciate the simplistic format of the piece.Maintaining livestock requires an abundance of resources, from water, feed, and land. Not only is it expensive to maintain, but the treatment practices of these animals are not regulated. People treat the animals very poorly, and abuse isn't uncommon in the meat industry.
   <br><br>
Food is a fundamental aspect of our lives, and we simply cannot live without constantly fueling ourselves. When Ken asks if we are the "architects" of the future, I began to question what I am doing to help solve the climate crisis. I believe that switching to a plant based diet is an important step towards the right direction. I began eating vegetarian once or twice a week, and hopefully eat more plant based meals.
   <br><br>
I believe that taking small steps are more important than taking drastic and unsustainable lifestyle changes.

Hello, I absolutely agree with you when it comes to making small, continuous changes in our lifestyles to improve the climate crisis. Going vegan or vegetarian is a huge step towards the right direction. The meat industry simply pollutes our environment far too much and if we all collectively changed our diets to more plant-based one, we could significantly reduce the need for meat, which would reduce the industry. Doing so would benefit everyone and everything, from people to the animals, and even the planet.

These videos have been stating similar if not the same information lately. The videos are kind of like iPhones - each new one has something "new" and "refreshing", but it's basically the same thing. Overall, I agree on how smaller houses can be great. The only problem is that the main people I see that are associated with those homes whenever they're getting promoted are people who are well off financially. I hardly see minorities in the videos. Yes the smaller homes should be more accessible along with able to accommodate a lower budget, but Ken should also realize that there are a bunch of minorities who are basically living in "tiny homes" in the cities, simply because they aren't able to afford anything else. It's difficult to make people reduce their home size when it's already small enough, on top of the fact that they yearn for something more in life since they've been at the bottom their entire lives. The promotion of these homes are indirectly shattering many peoples' dreams of a better life. "The American Dream is not healthy for the climate" you might argue, but many of the people in the films already had a taste of the "lavish lifestyle",  so it was easier to make the change. Try convincing people from underrepresented areas to continue living in their tiny home for the rest of their life. Radicamos en South Central 💯

I agree, smaller houses are a great idea that can help with the climate crisis. But most of all, there are families that are already living in tight, one bedroom apartments simply because they can't afford anything more, just as you said. It's frustrating seeing how minorities are underrepresented in these videos because it's always easy for Ken to say "we should do this" when it's not an option for some people. Or when people see it as a cute, niche choice to living, which one can say is a good mindset so we switch away from wanting more, but we have to acknowledge that there are already minorities doing these things. Even with the most minimum, families still rely on cars to get to their low paying jobs; the bus is an option but it's so unreliable. This is why public transport needs to be improved, but that's just one problem out of the many we've seen in the videos, but only through the eyes of the privileged people who choose to do these things rather than be forced to, or pat themselves on the back for living "minimalistic" with one room tiny houses though they've already experienced the world and have a good income. When we move forward with the Green New Deal, it's so important to keep the working class in mind.

I agree with your ideas. To be honest, humans are 1.7 meter square on average. Why do we need the villas which are way much larger than what we really need? Those large houses usually contain the personal gym, theater,  large dining rooms, game rooms, and multiple bedrooms. In order to clean and maintain these rooms, the owners need to hire more workers and consume more unnecessarily. This is leading to consumerism again. My ideal housing is living in a community apartment. There are the gym, theater, and other shared public facilities in the community center. It actually costs less with better service. The "lavish lifestyle" is really unnecessary and lonely. How life is like does not depend on how you value your life quality rather than how much money you invest in the house.
<br><hr>
I agree with you, the videos and materials we have been presented with is very frustrating as it underrepresents those of us who are minorities. Many minorities live in “micro-apartments” or “co-house” because it is the only way they will have a roof over their heads. Personally, my dad had once lived, which means I had once lived part time in a house that was housing 11 people , 2 families, plus grandparents living in a 3 bedroom home, not by choice. Then we are told to accept this lifestyle for our futures because it is environmentally conscious by people who at one point reached the “American Dream” that our families came here for. I know that this lifestyle is the way of the future and is vital to the saving of our planet, however I share in your frustration. Another point I'd like to add is the number one point of pollution found in the American home is refrigerants and I have grown up for the most part in a lower class to lower middle-class area and most of my friends back home don’t have a working AC in their homes and if they do they don’t use it because if the expensive bill that comes with it, that’s how it is my household. Therefore ,I think this perfectly exhibits the power of the more financially stable in the US. I also believe that as we continue to move forward with action to prevent the worsening of our climate crisis that we keep in mind lower-income families and protect them as much as possible to battle climate injustice and not just here in the US but across the globe because they will pay the most for having doe the least.

<br><hr>
I am glad somebody has addressed this issue as I have noticed some of these same gaps in the course videos myself lately. While I think that overall Ken does an excellent job of addressing the ways in which the middle and upper classes of our society can personally address their climate impact, I think that addressing the shortcomings of these suggestions when addressing the communities that are less affluent and traditionally underfunded/underserved is of the utmost importance in a class about the climate crisis. The crisis is principally impacting the least affluent and most vulnerable portions of our population, which we have addressed to some extent on a global scale, but much less so in terms of those experiencing environmental injustice within the boundaries of our own country. I know it is not my place to make these suggestions in any way, as I recognize the privilege I have to have not been impacted by financial insecurity and the oppressive structures of capitalism to nearly the same extent. That said, I think this course could be doing a better job of giving voice to some of the obstacles faced by those communities who are not financially able to dramatically change their lifestyles and carbon consumption. The suggestions Ken has made up until now have significant merit but possess significant gaps for implementation on a wide scale for this reason. I have had the privilege to dream of downsizing from my large family home to a tiny house in the future, which is truly a massive luxury that, as is alluded to by the previous comment, many would likely scoff at because of their simple inability to afford anything but a "tiny house" under our current economic and capitalistic system that prioritizes the wealthiest portion of our population. 
   <br><br>

It is time we gave a much larger platform and voice to those most effected by environmental and climate injustice, rather than making generalized declarations about what we should be expected to do to reduce our impact. It just isn't that simple. The people of Flint, Michigan are majority bankrupt and struggling to make ends meet while consuming a poisoned water supply that causes cancer simply due to negligence and lack of action by the government. The people living in Louisiana's Cancer Alley are largely destitute and experiencing unprecedented rates of illness and cancer that suck every last dime of their income into a dramatically expensive slew of medical bills they cannot possibly afford to pay. True, very few of the residences in these areas are LEED certified or even energy efficient, but under these conditions, there is no way we can realistically expect the people living here to spend what little they have to essentially reinvent the way they consume their resources. When you are working just to make ends meet, everything else becomes a secondary priority and rightfully so. Until we as a country enact legislation that supports these communities and address the massive issues of environmental racism and inequality in our country, we cannot make demands of these communities about changing consumption habits to reduce their carbon footprint. The middle and upper classes that have these luxuries need to take action and fight to support these communities in any way we can, but above all else we need to give a voice to the largest victims of the climate crisis and stop making demands of them that will simply frustrate and alienate them from the matter completely. 
   <br><br>

That said, the most concrete way that we can enact effective change and give voice to those communities in this critical climate crisis era is by voting for candidates (aka BERNIE) who have proven themselves to be champions of the people, that will tax the rich and redistribute the massive amount of wealth that the richest 1% cling to like a lifeline. We must support one another collectively as a nation and allow the most marginalized to lead the fight so to speak if we are to enact any effective change that will work across the board for all members of our population, not just the 1%.
<br><hr>
I'd have to agree with you on this one... Ken tends to show modern visuals of scenarios that would be exclusively accessible to the middle/upper class. However, I think that our professor fails to consider that there already are thousands of families already living the compact, tiny house kind of lifestyle because they really cannot afford any greater alternative. Back home, I personally lived in a 2-bedroom mobile home that houses seven of us... if you don't call that micro living then I wouldn't know what is. The thing is, as much as we'd want a little more room to stretch our feet out and stuff, we simply can't afford it.
<br><hr>
I definitely agree with some of your concerns. Instead of trying to convince people to go super small we should all be aiming for a small sized house/apartment, even if that means some impoverished families will be moving up into relatively larger homes. It is the middle class and upper class that should make the change to smaller housing and who can benefit greatly from such a change. We should also encourage a cultural shift away from prioritizing large homes and multiple cars. We need to have a culture where motorized vehicles are extremely rare, like for only transporting materials or for ambulances and other emergency services. Cultural changes are paramount to effectively combating climate change and instead of forcing everyone to reduce when they barely have anything to start with, we should aim to trend towards a certain level.
<br><hr>
I agree with you that a lot of the information we’ve seen recently has been overlapping, and I agree with you that a lot of those minority populations already in small homes shouldn't feel pressured to meet these climate-conscious choices. It’s not their fault, it’s the fault of local, state, and national government for not providing easy access to housing that is not only small but also a viable and safe option for people of all backgrounds. I think when it comes to the climate crisis it’s also to mitigate the effects of gaps in pay, that’s why I think different systems are going to have to implement different levels of luxury of small homes. Although it might seem “extra” having these tiers of homes, it would still attract the desire of Americans who want to have “the best” as they “worked hard” and “deserve nice things”, while also still being much more greenhouse gas friendly.
<br><hr>
I believe you brought up a really good point. Although it would be great if everyone could transition into sustainable lifestyles, it is not possible for many people because financial boundaries. I've noticed that many of the videos we have watched focus on upper middle class, educated individuals who decide to leave behind their lavish lifestyles to downsize and adopt minimalist lifestyles. However, the reality is that many people cannot simply drop their career paths to dedicate their lives to become spokespeople of green lifestyles. I understand that obviously the purpose of these videos is to encourage people to adopt green lifestyles, I just wish that we could learn about people in a broader range of economic and social classes. Additionally, I wish that more videos could tell us about how the environmental movement involves POC and other minority groups. The environmental movement is meant to involve all groups and I hope we can hear a variety of perspectives before the class is over.
<br><hr>
I agree to a certain point with both sides. However, I don't think smaller homes should equal poor living conditions. A house does not have to be huge in size to represent the "American Dream," that's the whole thing that got us into this mess. I have personal experience with both social classes and understand the struggles each hold. I do believe lower-class families should receive help from the government in order to transition into eco-friendly homes as their financial situation may not be able to handle it on its own. I agree it is easier for upper-class families to complete this transition, but their situations should not be pushed to the side either.
<br><hr>
I think the problem is deeper than it appears to be. Being from South Central too I see what you're talking about, my parents still to this day talk about living in a two-story home but it's really not necessary unless you have a huge family like most of minorities do and that's due to lack of education, among women especially. We Latinos come from a culture where having 4-6 kids is normal when its not and that's where we see the struggle in living in these tight homes and having to provide for all of those in the household. 
   <br><br>
There's issues with every culture and yeah maybe it won't be easy to convince our people to continue living small but we can do other things like changing our diets because we do love our tacos, tortas, burritos, carne asadas, and the list goes on. Yes it's unfair that throughout most of our lives we've gotten the worst end of things but there's no time to try and live lavishly anymore, unfortunately for us who never got to see what that life is like but we don't need it. We don't need big houses to feel fulfilled, the only thing that that would do is make us want more and wanting more is the reason we're in this climate crisis in the first place. If people in 4-member families in Japan can live in 400 sq ft homes, why can't we?
   <br><br>
I think it goes back to the American Dream being sold to us making us believe that bigger is better. Eventually we'd find out that that's a lie. There's no space for me to sleep when I go home because my house is filled with people but I've never thought of myself as being in the bottom, we are where people should be and maybe Ken isn't asking for us minorities to downsize but to those who do live in big homes. We're ahead of the game! We already live in these small homes, is it comfortable? Not really (for a lot of reasons) but the planet is at stake here, no planet no nothing. And if we're already contributing to reducing emissions by living in these small homes then the next thing to do is find other ways to help out more, i.e. by consuming less meat, buying less things, and using public transport which in areas like South Central we already do.

"The promotion of these homes are indirectly shattering many peoples' dreams of a better"
   <br><br>


This was a powerful quote that summarizes the problem with trying to promote a simpler and smaller lifestyle. It is definitely ideal for people to have simpler and smaller lifestyles, but it is easy to forget how important the culturally ingrained concept of a "better lifestyle" is our society. When people across the world think of a "successful life", the idea of a big house, fancy car, etc immediately comes to mind. This is what drives people everyday: working hard to try and achieve these things. Though this mentality maybe be wrong and harmful for our environment, the fact is that there must be a culture and mindset shift in order to move away from it.
<br><hr>
Big Facts. There have been many lectures that I haven't been able to relate to, and this lecture is one of them. For all 18 years of my life I have lived in the same small two bedroom apartment, and I'm supposed to stay in similar housing conditions like that for the rest of my life? It is easier for the wealthier folks to decide to switch and change because they have been able to enjoy the wonderful "riches" of the American Dream, meanwhile the closest I have come to it is in the video game, Grand Theft Auto 5. Anyways, I'm not saying that our (the non-wealthy) wishes/desires are more important than the well-being of our planet, but this is definitely not fair. So far you, Ken , have not addressed us in any lecture or given us any advice on what to do. Out of these 10 weeks we have in your class can we at least get a short 5 minute clip for us, the underrepresented areas/people? Shout out South Central.
   <br><br>

"The promotion of these homes are indirectly shattering many peoples' dreams of a better life" Wow, I hit that like bottom as soon as I read this sentence for it is so true. Although my family now lives in a relatively bigger apartment now (still an apartment so not as big as a villa), I do remember the time when my parents worked hard days and nights to persue a better housing or "better life" in general. It is hard to give up that dream of lying on a big warm bed and having a two-stories villa with a garage and a backyard with pool in it. Promotion of smaller housing is definately great for our planet, but what about families? People have worked hard in hope that their future offsprings can live the best lives possible, yet such promotion puts off the fire of passionate dreaming and left people doubting their goal of hardworking
<br><hr>

To elaborate on this point you’ve made, I think most of the suggestions, if not all of the suggestions Ken makes in his lecture videos, are aimed at middle to higher income families and individuals who can afford to make these choices from a meat-incorporated diet to a healthy plant-based one or have the time to vote in elections during the week when most people have to work; taking one day off of work may seem insignificant, but for families struggling to make ends meet, a day off could be detrimental.  Another example is encouraging families to install voltaic solar cells on homes and increase insulation; these are only options that only families who can afford elective remodeling of their homes.  He says these actions aren’t enough, but many people can’t even afford to do such.  I think he skips over a large demographic in these lecture videos seeing as not everyone watching is in a position to make these kind of lifestyle changes.

<br><hr>
Right. So many people who are privileged enough to try out minimalism don't see the struggle other families have. I was constantly annoyed when watching the "Minimalism" film that's on Netflix because it was only people who were making a lot of bank that were like "Yeah it's a lot more freeing when you don't own a lot of things". For example, the guy who worked on Wall Street and was earning a six figure salary. And yes public transport needs to be heavily revamped to promote the usage of it more. As of right now, it's seen as something the lower class uses, which in a sense, is true in many places.
<br><hr>
I agree. A lot of the climate crisis solutions are geared towards the middle/upper class. Just like your friends, I grew up in a household where I didn't have a working AC- in fact, I never had an actual AC in my home. And I feel you on living with a bunch of relatives in one home. A lot of my friends live in tiny apartments full of relatives due to many reasons. The primary reason is cause of insufficient funds to move to a larger home. Being able to afford proper housing is tough, especially when working a minimum-wage job. What doesn't help also is the constant gentrification that is ongoing. This increases rent more than it already is, which results in families being driven out of their home. There are a bunch of problems that need to be addressed but aren't being discussed enough. We need to increase awareness on these issues.
<br><hr>
Thank you for you comment. I really liked the part "...there is no way we can realistically expect the people living here to spend what little they have to essentially reinvent the way they consume their resources" because that is basically what Ken is asking for. Now, he can say "Well then those possible solutions aren't for them", but then that brings up the question, "What can we do then?" And yes, the best way in the end to give voice to these communities is by voting candidates who are willing to provide that voice for them into office.
<br><hr>
The main point that I was aiming for is that a lot of the solutions that Ken provides would only be useful for middle/upper class. A lot of minorities are in the lower class, and if you think about it, they already live a minimalist lifestyle, not by choice but because they're forced to. So that begs the question, what can THEY do since they already do things that Ken recommends? And the other point is that it kind many people want to live a better lifestyle overall, but they can't because of their financial situation. It's not necessarily that small homes equal poor living conditions. It's that they BARELY have enough money to cover that small home, while the middle/upper class could easily afford it and have plenty of money left over for whatever else, such as providing for their family, something that the lower class always have to worry about.
<br><hr>
I agree too, while hearing about these solutions of "tiny houses" does help those who first learn of their impact, I believe Ken is somewhat "preaching to the choir." Those who COULD help should pay attention to the video as maybe his repetition is to instill the obligation to those who can change their lifestyles. However many of us don't really have that option to do so.  Addressing our issues to policy makers is all that some of us could do and hopefully they can start making that change we need.
<br><hr>


I understand what you mean, that we are ahead of the curve in terms of reducing our carbon footprint. But like you said, it's deeper than that. Why do families who live in the hood in small apartments and such want to move up? For numerous reasons, such as for us Latinos whose parents came to the U.S in hopes of getting a better life for them and their (future) children. Another reason is because the area itself. I mentioned the term "underrepresented areas". Why did I mention this term? Well because those are usually places that have a higher crime rate and lower average income. So of course people want to move up in the social ladder; they want to get out of there and move to an overall nicer area that is much safer. Why do you think many hip-hop/rap artists flaunt their new wealth? Because they are grateful that they made it out of the bad areas and can now support their families. Now, we don't have to go to that extent, but we can at least improve those areas if you really want them to continue living paycheck to paycheck, living their minimalist lifestyle because they're forced to. 
   <br><br>
Also, many families don't even have the luxury of buying extra clothes because money is already tight enough as it is. I've had friends who went to school using a lot of the same sweaters and shoes because they didn't have anything else other than that. As for public transportation, it can be vastly improved. I've been on bus rides where the buses weren't entirely clean in many aspects. This is one of the reasons why there is a big stigma of public transportation being for the lower class. Possibly the main thing that we could do is consume less meat, but as you mentioned yourself, it'll be hard to convince our people to make that change since it's basically part of our culture. This ties into what I'm saying, that it isn't as easy as Ken believes, just telling people "Do this" and "Do that".
<br><hr>
I really would like to see that. We need something that we can benefit from. It's been almost the same thing every lecture, but we can't use them those solutions that much as the middle/upper class. What this class is missing is a lecture or even a small segment that would address the lower class and their role. Hopefully Ken does this but who knows. I know there's plenty others in the class that have the same sentiments.
<br><hr>
Exactly. We need a balance to ensure that we keep that incentive of working hard. If we just tell people that already live in small, run down homes, "Hey, you should live there for the rest of your life along with your family because it's healthier for the environment", that would just make them not want to work as hard as before because in their mind, they'll be like "What's the point. I'm not gonna be able to improve this living situation anyways". Once that happens, the economy will go down. We need to keep that incentive up there.
<br><hr>
I totally agree with your statements. In each video, Ken presents a lot of things that we could do to make an impact on the climate crisis, but often spends little time addressing the fact that many people live this way out of necessity rather than choice. I would imagine he does this because, considering he is lecturing to students at a UC school, the majority of his audience are likely well off enough to have the choice. While i can respect this, I think this is something we should take extra care to point out for a number of reasons. First off, when one understands that being vegan, for example, is not a fad diet for the majority of vegans outside of developed nations; one can better appreciate the value of meat on a global scale. With this perspective, the concept of restricting meat consumption becomes more tangible. Additionally, solutions to secondary problems become apparent when this concept is addressed. For example, if one considers that water consumption is not a certainty in much of the world, it serves as a secondary motivator to reduce water consumption. Perspective and motivation may seem unimportant in the grand sceme of things, however, persuading the public to revalue their values and lifestyles is vastly important to this cause. While we did touch on environmental justice in the begining of this course, I feel as though your exact point and how it applies to this course has not been adressed in the proper mannor and is extremely valuable to this course.
<br><hr>
Period.

I agree with your comment. It’s really easy to be a good person and have a small carbon footprint when you’re poor. Immigrant parents want us to have more because they believe the more we have, the higher our success. They came from nothing, and they want us to have everything. Being educated on the climate crisis, it obviously kind of changes our views on how we should be living. But for a lot of people, it doesn’t change their values. They want to do better and show they’re doing better for their parents. It is, like Andrew mentioned, to step down to a humble lifestyle if you already have a taste of the lavish. In the last film, we learned that the more people have, we think about the less we have. We just have to find a common ground with our values and what we know is right for ourselves and our world.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with you and those who replied above. I initially thought I clicked onto the wrong lecture video because it started off very similarly to one we just watched a couple weeks ago. Although a very small portion of this video is information that has not been explicitly said before in a lecture on YouTube, it is mostly recycled material that we are hearing. I agree with almost everything said in Ken's lectures, but some of the solutions he mentions fails to acknowledge many of the confounding variables that make pursuing change difficult. 
   <br><br>
Growing up I shared a bedroom with four of my siblings, so I didn't see much space or privacy at all. My entire family had no other option but to share rooms to accommodate all 8 of us in a two bedroom apartment. For those of us who are forced to live in tight spaces due to financial constraints we want nothing more but to live a better life with all the space and privacy we could imagine; that's always been the goal and that's what our parents usually want for us. Not to mention that micro-apartments are most likely going to be very expensive since they reside within major cities. Although living in a compact home as an adult won't be much different as to when I was a child, I still have trouble with the thought of conforming to a small and extremely simple lifestyle when all my life I have aspired to live in a relatively moderate sized home (roughly 1,500 sq. ft.) if not a large one since this was my one definition of what it is to be successful.

<br><hr>
I agree with Ayou about these videos I feel like these are the same thing every week with very little difference. I also agree with his comment about house sizes among minorities.  He said that many minorities already are living in these tiny houses technically.  Many are forced to live in these homes as mentioned by Andrew.  I wanted to connect the idea of many practices of solutions towards climate change and many other things as well is a struggle for low-income families than the upper class.  The upper class could afford change and this emphasizes how the wealthy will not suffer due to climate change as much as the low-income families.  I also agree with the fact of asking the low-income families to stay in their little box is insulting and the wealthy should have their turn in a suffocating box of a house if they are the ones that want to better the environment by telling the low-income families to pack more family inside their house than them to reduce their house size themselves.
<br><hr>
As unfortunate as it sounds, changing the climate requires effort from everyone, the poor and rich. Having someone who has lived in small house their entire life shouldn't be exempt from the rules simply because they haven't experienced the same lavish lifestyle. When Ken states that people should downsize on their house size, this probably doesn't apply to those with already small houses. As to one of your points, some will argue the complete opposite of you and say that BECAUSE certain people have experienced a lavish lifestyle, they are the ones less likely to drop everything and switch to a new way of life. In the next couple years after these people have moved into modestly sized houses, can't we say the exact same thing to them? What's the point then? Is the prospect in living in a semi-decent house for a decade worth all of the issues it may cause? I would also like to point out that a very large portion of this course is convincing us that there are other ways we can live happy,  prosperous lives without having a large homes. The point is to spread awareness to everyone, it just so happens that a large majority of the demographic is catered to an upper-middle class. Just because this is the case, doesn't mean any of the information/purpose is different. Any change is influential!

<br><hr>
I agree with you. I’m going to be honest I wasn’t even thinking about the minorities until you said something. I was just listening to what ken said and was thinking “yeah it’s just that simple” but it’s not. People are already living in tiny apartments with a ton of people. I know of people who literally have two families living in a small two bedroom apartment just because they can’t afford anything else. The minorities are definitely misrepresented in these videos. It would be nice though if people who live in big apartments and houses would downsize but the reality is they won’t. Most people who have the money to own big houses aren’t going to own smaller ones. Most of the time rich people like to flaunt there money and that is one way of how they do that.

<br><hr>
I think both this comment and your reply are really important points that should be considered at all times when discussing the climate crisis. Throughout all these videos, Ken has addressed the lifestyles of American people who have money and are able to spend their money on carbon-producing activities. Yes, we have looked into how peoples’ modern way of living has such a drastic effect on the developing countries that have no financial or industrial support. But, it is rarely talked about how a large majority of the United States is struggling financially, relying on their car to get to possibly multiple jobs in one day, only to come home to their tiny home. I completely agree with your statement on putting more of the government’s expenses into public transportation, because I agree that when I have taken the bus downtown or to work, there have been times where I am late and this has an effect on my paycheck. Some people don’t have the finances to change their lifestyle in terms of housing and transportation, because the way they are living now is not always by choice. It is by them having to keep an income to support themselves plus their families. I think it is incredibly important to address flying, cars, huge houses, etc when talking about the climate crisis, but it is also equally incredibly important to address the millions of people who don’t have access to these things in the first place, and what they can do to make small changes in their life while still providing for themselves.
<br><hr>
I agree with your points. I love to live somewhere small. Not only because it means I can have more personal space to do whatever I want and release my personal stress but also, I can provide some positive impact on the environment. I could just use less power and consumption than my parents who live in a house than 3 bigger than my loft. What is more, it is also cheaper for you to live. As long as you live in a small space, you have just had less mood to buy more furniture to decorate your space. Like japan where I traveled before, the hotel I lived in is much smaller than the Chinese hotel or Americans’ hotels. But the supplies and furniture are all practical to use. Nevertheless, using the limited resources in a practical way is part of the action in the green deal.
<br><hr>
I agree. While Ken encourages us to live in small houses, many people have already lived in such situation due to lack of money. Even so, I still hold a positive opinion on the idea of bringing nature to the city. No matter what the reason is for people living in co-housing and small houses, this action is environmentally friendly. As one third of climate footprint comes from our homes, we must eliminate the carbon emission through our housing activities in order to minimize the greenhouse gas emission as a whole. Although stop ecologically destructive activities that encroach on wilderness is important, focussing on places that have already had human works and projects can minimize the damage humans have done. 
   <br><br>
Furthermore, connecting with Thoreau’s Walden, Ken discusses feasibility of his minimalism. By comparing units in adAPT program with Thoreau’s wooden house, he finds that small units in city is surprisingly close to Thoreau’s ideal size for domestic simplicity. However, later he criticizes Thoreau for taking the lead of moving to suburb areas because living in suburb means emitting more greenhouse gas. His intention is good, but people who blindly follow him are the causes of the environmental disaster.
<br><hr>
This video is indeed inspiring and it reminds me of quite a lot of things that I haven’t even thought of before. Especially the movement to suburbs as the fashion of the 20th century. This living style is really quite devastating to the environment according to its increased transportation miles and larger houses and thus warming requirement. When I was young, I was always informed of the cities’ environmental hazard, including light pollution, noise pollution etc. I seemed to unconsciously connect these unagreeable living conditions with environmental pollution since they all contain the word “pollution”. However, what I didn’t think about is the density in the city and thus the comparatively low carbon footprint when living in the city, a more condensed and simple life, go to work and go back and sleep. It is quite interesting to think about the de-urbanization should be a feature for post-industrialized society, however, people come back again to the city because of environmental protection, seemingly a loop between cities and suburbs.
<br><hr>
I see your point and partially agree with you.  I see how a lot of lower-income families thrive to come up and do better for themselves.  Being in a Hispanic household, education is highly stressed and seen as a way to get out of their current situation.  Many people who have never obtained that lifestyle idolize it and wish to achieve it for themselves one day.  I can't totally separate myself from this mindset but I also think it's important to try and change the way that society thinks.  Happiness doesn't come from money and focusing our efforts on trying to save our planet may be more important than trying to get rich.  Puro Rancho Humilde 💯
<br><hr>
I completely agree with your comment. I understand and agree that smaller homes are great for the environment. Tiny homes are “the cool new thing,”  for the privileged, while for so many minorities a “tiny home” is the only home we’ve known because it’s all our parents could afford. Many of us grew up seeing how hard our parents worked and struggled to provide us food and a roof over our heads, so our goal is to one day give back to them. “The promotion of these hoes are indirectly shattering many people's’ dreams of a better life.” I can agree that our “American Dream” is flawed, and unhealthy for the environment, but now everyone is paying the price for the few who already fulfilled their “American Dream” and enjoyed their lavish life. Those who already experienced their fair share of luxury and comfort now want to “size down” and get into minimalism, and that’s great. However, I also think it's inconsiderate to expect underrepresented minorities to give up their dream of a better life. It’s unfair that I should give up my dream of a big home and backyard, out of guilt and responsibility for the planet, while billionaires continue living in mansions and flying private jets. Not to say two wrongs make a right, but billionaires should be addressed and dealt with. I say we k*ll the rich, redistribute wealth, and solve this climate crisis. Sí o no raza, amonos recio 💯
<br><hr>
Yes exactly!  The way I see it, the climate crisis is something that has become an increasingly popular discussion in the past few years through mediated forms.  As have certain things that will, in small ways, prevent the climate crisis like tiny houses, biking instead of driving etc.  But from what I recall growing up, the “cool” thing was to be rich, have a fancy car, a big house etc.  So for many people who never had what more privileged people had growing up, that was something to look forward to.  It was like ‘okay maybe right now I don’t have all the cool things other kids have, but one day I’ll get it for myself’.  But now in some ways everyone’s expected to cut down and live smaller, and some people didn’t even get the taste of what it’s like to NOT live smaller.  So now what, the new thing to do is live small, ride a bike, etc. and so many people are gonna feel like ‘ok well… I’ve never even owned a car and my childhood home is half the size of a lot of people I know’.  Anyways this turned into more of a rant but I guess my point is that it’s hard to expect a majority of the populations’ mindset to change when we as humans are constantly striving for ‘more’ and ‘better’.  So until we have a different notion of what ‘more and better’ is there is going to be some upset from these expectations.
<br><hr>
You bring up really good points, the first being how many of the videos offering similar solutions but tweaked a little bit to improve the way of living. I had the same idea about minority groups not being able to afford a larger space and their only option really is to live in reduced small spaces. I remember when I was growing up, my parents didn't have much money to buy their own home so we lived in my grandparents house along with my 3 other aunts and their kids, so in total there was about 15 of us in a 3 bedroom house. I enjoyed living with family but as a young child I didn't understand the severity of the money issue my parents had to deal with. Now my parents have their own home which is relatively large, and if I were to bring up the idea of micro-housing they would think I'm crazy and talking non sense. In which I would agree, they spent their whole life working hard for the money they worked for and in my opinion they deserve the absolute best from it. I think that those already not keen to the idea of reducing their living arrangement that they be cautious on the things they buy and make minimalistic decisions as a way to combat the climate crisis.

<br><hr>
Your points are valid and your concerns very justified, however I don't the promotion of smaller homes and co housing should in any way negatively impacts peoples aspirations for financial gain or affluence. What I got from Ken's lecture, is that we need to change how people choose to express their monetary success. I shouldn't be displayed through limitless consumerism or exuberant houses. In its essence, in order to achieve a more carbon neutral future, we need to change what people believe is the "American Dream". Personal initiative and limitless ambition will always be a core feature of the American spirit, but our appetite for consumption and displays of wealth must become a thing of the past. Obviously, every American family should be able to afford comfortable housing and affordable healthy options for food and entertainment, but their needs to be a cultural change in how we as a society perceive success.
   <br><br>
The recent mobilization of people towards our urban centers gives me a lot of hope for the future, but that alone is not enough to address the great deal of carbon produced by our current lifestyles. At the end of the day, its our generation that will determine the direction our culture moves in, and while we should all strive to live better lives than our parents, we need to do this with consciousness and caution.
<br><hr>
This comment wowed me. This is something that has not been discussed when talking about tiny houses but definitely should be. All across the world and even right here in the U.S. there are people already living in "tiny homes". The difference with those people is that they do not have a choice. Think about the American Dream. Whenever I think about it I picture a big house with a big front/backyard, a white picket fence and rocking chairs on the porch. This image has been something that people have been fighting for their whole lives and it is suddenly something that they shouldn't want. I completely understand the point of tiny homes and all of the benefits that they have for the environment. However, I also think it is important that we remain aware of other peoples situations as well so that we do not sound naive and selfish.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with you, I believe small homes would be great for all of the upper class citizens who live in McMansions to downsize and reduce their carbon footprint. I also believe that the only reason many minorities are found in smaller homes is because they are less likely to be able to afford anything bigger. The truth in the matter is that it is mostly the privileged few that are contributing to tons of more emission rather than poorer families. We have to focus our efforts on changing the American dream to be sustainable for our environment and our species. This means no more using any of the excess and unnecessary items that we as a country have grown accustomed to. Every city has to come up with ways that they can reduce their climate impact, especially in terms of the accountability of those who contribute more.
<br><hr>
Your comment really brings a new concept to me. I’ve never thought about people living in tiny houses in the climate issues before. I think you are absolutely right. The ones who need to be educated about the climate crisis are those who are rich enough to buy a Mcmansion, with more than one car. As an international student from China, I know a lot about small houses. China has a population of about 1.4 billion, so the majority people live in apartments in skyscrapers. I don’t think it’s bad to live in a 3B2B apartment with your neighbor right next to you. So I think wealthy people who are considering getting a fancy big mansion should really reconsider their plan and buy less, use less.
<br><hr>
I have relatives that lived in soviet communal housing. Several families shared a single kitchen and bathroom, one room for a family was normal. Today, they are very happy they don't need to live in those conditions.
   <br><br>
I agree with you, I think it is hard to convince anyone who grew up in that kind of environment to downsize again.

<br><hr>
I agree with you that a lot of the information we’ve seen recently has been overlapping, and I agree with you that a lot of those minority populations already in small homes shouldn't feel pressured to meet these climate-conscious choices. It’s not their fault, it’s the fault of local, state, and national government for not providing easy access to housing that is not only small but also a viable and safe option for people of all backgrounds. I think when it comes to the climate crisis it’s also to mitigate the effects of gaps in pay, that’s why I think different systems are going to have to implement different levels of luxury of small homes. Although it might seem “extra” having these tiers of homes, it would still attract the desire of Americans who want to have “the best” as they “worked hard” and “deserve nice things”, while also still being much more greenhouse gas friendly.
<br><hr>
I could not agree with this comment more. I think that there needs to be more representation of BI & POC so we can see where they are coming from and who are the most impacted individuals. I think that it is not about continuously showing (nicely) what the 1% of the WORLD can do, but to really humble people and tell them that "everything that came at your convenience is built off of someone else's labor and handwork. I feel that if people could all just wake up and know what its like out there, and empathize, and take action to change, perhaps this world would be a lot better.
<br><hr>
This comment was really refreshing. Finally, someone who is outwardly addressing the fact that it seems like only privileged white families or individuals are featured in the content we are given. I understand that most of these participants have the financial or physical resources needed to renovate and modernize such houses, but why is it that we focus on praising and following these people. I want to see how regular people, with similar resources as I do, have transformed their lives to be eco-friendly and reduce their carbon footprint. I feel like if we made the norm to have a minimalistic way of living, we wouldn't have to watch people who have the means to completely transform their old living style to a more aesthetically pleasing lifestyle. Many families don't have a choice but to live simplistically.
<br><hr>
It is a harsh reality for many people that their large homes are bad for the environment and it is probably the hardest for me to get around to. Flight restrictions, vegan based diets, and non-automobile modes of transportation seem adjustments I could make to my life but the idea of having a small house seems restricting to me. Both of my parents grew up poor and dreamed of having a decently sized house and through hard work, they accomplished that; I think that it is radical to say that they do not deserve it. What I think we should focus on is making excessively large homes not socially acceptable and to make homes more eco-friendly and use better sustainable practices.
<br><hr>
Yeah, this pretty much hits the nail on the head. These videos talk about "downsizing" and "altering expectations" and "putting aside the American Dream" for the people who...already achieved it. It's literally the haves telling the have-nots that "having isn't everything my guy".
<br><hr>
I agree with your point in regard to many minorities already living in small homes. While it is true that small homes are more environmentally friendly, there is a limit to what people will reduce their living area to. I believe this message applies mostly to the more affluent individuals within our society; however, it is difficult to change what for some is the American Dream. In order to persuade people into not striving for a bigger home, we need to redefine what constitutes as achieving the American Dream or rather what it means to be successful within our society. Similar to the housing aspect of the American Dream, driving and owning an expensive car can also be seen as a marker for success. While public transportation is more environmentally friendly than owning and operating a car, many would rather still work hard for a car because of our cultural perception. We see people that have many expensive cars as successful versus seeing people that use public transportation as poor because they cannot afford a car of their own. Overall, we need to redefine what the American Dream is if we wish to persuade the general public into voluntarily giving up what many consider as luxuries.
<br><hr>
That's a good point. I don't think those few people should suffer the consequences. They already live in small houses.We want to be sustainable, but we also want to reduce the income gap, so that people become more equal to each other.But it also motivates people to work hard, to work hard, to a degree that gives them the freedom to pursue what they want, to feel that they deserve better.
<br><hr>
I agree with you that these videos are starting to get somewhat repetitive. I've noticed this trend starting from earlier in the course. At the same time, given how some people in this class may study by skimming videos. Repetitive content like this may help people really solidify the important information. I agree that it is definitely easier, mentally mainly, for richer people to downgrade to a smaller, more efficient house. People at the bottom of the ladder are sick of being there. They want to really feel the fruits of their labor by spending lots of money and living in bigger houses. Trying to convince people like this that they should still live in a small house may prove to be very difficult. International people, especially, will not enjoy the idea of going against the "American Dream", as that may have been a primary reason for moving to the US in the first place. They may not agree with this kind of progressive thinking. I know my parents wouldn't be very happy downgrading their lifestyle, as they seem to enjoy it a lot.

After watching this week's lecture of "Housing and Cities" I had a different view of the environmental impact of cities. I always thought of cities being super crowded, polluted, and hectic. Although sometimes these are true, there are actually many positive aspects of city living, in regards to reducing ones carbon footprint. One of the main ways city living reduces CO2 emissions is small housing. In many busy cities there is apartment style housing, which is vertical housing. This leads to the sharing of resources and less consumerism, which reduces CO2 emissions drastically. Cooling and heating systems release much less greenhouse gases in smaller houses as well. Most people who live in cities work within that same city, meaning they have a short commute to work. People are able to walk to work or ride bikes. Additionally, busy cities have major traffic and limited parking, which incentives people to ride bikes or take the bus to work. Some people love this lifestyle, while other prefer to live in suburbs. I personally do not love cities and like settings with more nature, however I support those who chose to live in cities as it reduces ones carbon footprint and contributes towards the climate change cause.

If you asked me before watching this lecture, I could confidently say I hate the city. Visiting it for a day is fine, maybe even a weekend, but I could never see myself living there. This is because I grew up in Northern California 45 minutes from San Francisco, and comparing the beautiful suburbs to the dirty, overcrowded city... it isn’t really a hard choice for me on which I prefer. I agree with what you said about your perspective of cities though, and must admit that mine may have been altered by this video a little bit too. I think that living in the city does have some really great benefits. The suburb lifestyle I grew up in just isn’t realistic anymore if we need to reduce carbon emissions from owning cars and commuting to work. Living where you work is much more environmentally conscious in so many ways. This includes micro-apartment living and sharing living spaces with other people. Being a college student though and basically living that lifestyle right now in Isla Vista (with absurdly high rent prices too), I shamefully admit this is a lifestyle I am greatly looking forward to moving on from. I respect the lifestyle choices of those who can live like this, especially long term and in their adult lives. For me though, the moment I am graduated I look forward to having my own place to live and escaping the claustrophobia of Isla Vista and certainly of a big city like San Francisco. I know it’s not the greatest thing to say, but the environment that I live in and what I am surrounded by is so important to me that I don’t think suburban living is an aspect of life I am willing to give up. I can live smaller, in a small house with a garden and solar panels and proper insulation, but I absolutely cannot live in a vertical apartment complex with 500 other people. Anacapa and my tiny apartment now have taught me that. Again, I respect people who can do it and believe me I aim to live a climate crisis conscious lifestyle in other ways, but I know myself and know that I would not fare well in a city lifestyle.

In this week "Housing and Cities" I learn more about things I can adjust to save more power, put less footprints. I try my best to turn off all lights when I leave the house, as well as not turning on the lights in daytime. For instance, I try going to the library or outside to study, instead of going to my room, which I have to turn on the light. I can handle the cold well, so I always set my heating system pretty low 68F. But I can't stand the heat well, so I do have the AC on strong during hot summer months. 
   <br><br>
As of the cities, I love how convenient things are to get around, but convenient stop us from switching to alternatives, rural, friendly mass transit. I hope that I'm able to change my lifestyle into more environmental friendly.

I completely agree with you in regard that living in the cities where everything is convenient it may be hard to transition into alternatives that will be more friendly to rural communities. Coming from the Central Valley where my family works in the fields it is hard to imagine an environmentally friendly alternative for transportation to become mainstream and available for the public to use. This is why it is incredibly important that those that have the privilege to reflect and change their lifestyles that is more environmentally friendly needs to be highlighted. As Ken mentioned cutting the square space in ones home is an extreme game changer and can help drastically improve the carbon footprint we are currently emitting into the atmosphere. People often do not think of minorities when proposing these solutions. Most of the time minorities are already living this lifestyle but without a choice. It is hard to impose this view to the people that are forced to live in this manner. Not only are they fighting against  their barely livable wages, but they also must face the gentrification they face. This is why any adaptation that we are capable of doing we must adopt-no matter how small-because many of us simply can not afford to.

I think that cohousing is a good idea and would be beneficial for a variety of reasons. If people began moving to the city and trying out co-housing, it would be significant in reducing carbon emissions. However, this isn’t the only benefit to moving into co-housing. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve realized that people’s social behaviors have changed a lot from what they used to be just a couple decades ago. Before, people would have a lot more interactions with neighbors and kids would play outside. Now, a majority of people don’t even know their neighbors names. In a world of social media and suburbia, people become very isolated and lonely. There is no sense of community anymore. Co-housing can have a huge impact on these people because it will increase their chances of making meaningful connections. This can be especially helpful for people such as the elderly, single working people, childless couples, and people new to the city. It is proven that more human connection and community leads to an increased quality of life, and it’s very possible that people can be happier in these shared houses than alone in the suburbs. The American dream of living in a suburban house with a white picket fence is one fueled by consumerism and it is time to let go and try other options.

I really appreciated Ken’s lecture video this week which presented different perspectives on housing and cities as well as their impact on climate change. First, I find it ironic that while large urban centers and metropolitan cities are often viewed as far worse for the climate than a suburban lifestyle or countryside living, just by considering how much more common the use of public transportation and carpooling is in large cities relative to how a suburbia lifestyle often involves multiple vehicles per household just to get to the places you need to be, in reality both living in cities and suburbia have their pros and cons. 

   <br><br>

Furthermore, as we’ve also covered earlier in the course, the widespread ideal of owning a large house also has its own negative ramifications for the climate crisis. However, I firmly believe that this is absolutely a cultural thing. Prior to living in California, the cost of real estate was much lower and so owning a large house was the norm for the middle class. However, in the Bay Area where the price of real estate is sky high, for the same amount of money a much smaller house that is perhaps a quarter the size is the reality. Moreover, in large cities, as I’ve experienced in highly populated Chinese cities like Beijing, owning a house as we see it in America is an extremely rare commodity and an apartment is a very expensive luxury. As a result, I think that depending on where you’ve grown up and where you’re living, people’s views on how much space they need and their ideal on housing changes radically. Finally, I think that microhousing is an intriguing ideal that is becoming commonplace in large cities and once again, expanding the accessibility and affordability of public transportation is a must.

I think it's interesting how owning a large house has so much value. I've even seen a couple of Instagram and Twitter memes with a caption and pictures of how x amount of money can get you a gigantic mansion in Texas, but a only a literal broomcloset in NYC. Having a big house is a unnecessary luxury few can afford, and we need to stop glamorizing it. It's hard to see celebrities giving a tour of their massive living spaces with 4 floors and 10 bedrooms that they live in by themselves. No one needs all that space just to live alone, and it only exponentially increases their carbon footprint. If we stop idolizing this lifestyle, more people would be happy with the idea of microhousing, which is so much more affordable and environmentally friendly.

I loved the idea of green cities.  Growing up in LA, I have always been a version of a city girl.  As I got older though and became more mindful of the environment around me, I started to do what Ken warned us against; I considered cities, especially my city, filled with dirty smog, heavy traffic, and trash littered streets, and dreamed about going elsewhere.  I had a Thoreau-esque desire to just drop everything and move to live a simple life, selfishly because it sounded very peaceful, but also because of the environmental impacts I believed it would have.  In actuality, though, after doing research and taking this class, I have learned otherwise.  I realize now how valuable cities are in their proximity and promotion of simplicity.  Of course, there are things that need to be addressed in cities to truly make them green, and ideas that could really bring it all together.  For example, like Ken said, urban gardens in neighborhoods and communities could be a great way to get local fruit and vegetables.  Green roofs can help insulate buildings and areas while also helping with smog in the air.  There are really great designs that are easy to find if you look up “green architecture” - it blows my mind how such beautiful buildings can be both space efficient, use solar energy to their advantage, and use gorgeous plants to its advantage.

      It is crazy to me the difference between American standards versus standards of living around the world.  I dislike the view of capital that we have, that bigger is better.  Of course, it is necessary for economic growth, but I think in the aspect of living, there is a certain amount that becomes too much.  In actuality, community living and smaller areas with more people not only builds community and friendships, but it reduces the individual carbon footprint of each person in that area.

I agree entirely.  As we keep talking about how 98% of our biosphere is made up of humans, our animals and our livestock, it just made me wonder how even having a green biosphere would be possible.  If all the space on the planet is just humans and our animals, how is it even possible to have a environment when its all industrialized.  The second half of Ken's lecture gave me a lot of hope, I felt like it introduced very interesting ideas and thoughts that I hadn't yet considered.   There is no reason Thoreuxs minimalist experiment needs to be limited to a rural area.  If everything has to be industrialized and humanized, we might as well do our best to continue to look for ways to make it green.  We have an obligation to look for new radical ideas and make them commonplace, make sustainable living more accessible and bring nature back into spaces that destroyed it.  Losing nature was an unintended consequence of our rapid growth.  Humans are too greedy for space, and natural life fell victim to that.  But it seems like the average person is not against nature, that everyone likes greenery and flowers and seeing nature around them.  Its great that many cities have started initiatives that promote less wasteful living made possible by reducing square footage.  But if everything we do as humans seems to release carbon into the air, the least we can do is find ways to introduce greenery to our urban areas that will release oxygen and hopefully absorb some of the carbon we so wastefully produce.

After watching this week's lecture it made me reflect on both of my aunts housing and commuting situations. They both live in Vancouver, B.C., in a neighborhood called Granville Island. Although both have high paying jobs and could afford homes, even in this expensive city, one lives in single condos and other other lives in a two bedroom apartment, both roughly around 300-400 square feet. Their housing situation meets all of their needs and all the spaces provide a purpose. While one of my aunts works from home and the other works downtown, both of their primary modes of transportation are the public bus and walking. When I go to visit them every summer, I adopt their way of living and see how convenient city living is compared to my normal suburban lifestyle. If we need to go to the store or want to go downtown it is a short 10-20 minute walk, and a very beautiful one at that. In Vancouver, this lifestyle is very common for the general public. Public transportation does not have the stigma it does in the U.S. and they have implemented many safe bike lanes to encourage less driving. They also have car services, similar to Zipcar, that encourages people not to own their own car, but rather rent one if needed for a daily excursion. Vancouver also requires composting and recycling for all residents. It is always so eye opening when I go visit them and see how green this large city can be and all of the efforts they have implemented to become even more environmentally friendly. When I visit them, it does not feel dirty or overcrowded like many cities may seem, I can see and feel the nature around me when I'm walking through the city, which I think is something that people would think to be the opposite. I think that Vancouver can serve as an amazing model that other big cities can look to when considering how to become more green and how it will benefit the people and the planet.

This lecture "Housing and Cities" showed me a new way of climate activism that I previously was unaware of. Moving to urban areas with smaller rooms and personal area certainly isn't ideal for everyone, but it helps the environment dramatically. Owning a personal bike rather than car is a primary environmental benefit of this. We all know from this class that bikes are much safer for the our planet than cars are, and living in an urban area would help the transition much easier. In addition, by sharing living space with multiple people and really limiting the space we live in, we would emit less harmful gases into the atmosphere. This change is certainly tough because everyone wants to have a nice house with a big front and back yard, with a three car garage. However, this isn't a necessary thing for us as humans. People who are willing to make the sacrifices for the environment will definitely look at moving to a city as a valuable option in reducing their carbon footprint. I would highly consider moving to a major city in a smaller place just to reduce mine, but everyone needs to know how important this change could be in climate activism.

I also found myself considering moving to a larger city based off of Ken's recommendation. People often want a larger house just for the sake of having it or to show off wealth, yet this is completely unnecessary. I was inspired to hear of New York's zoning changes and their changes in housing because that particular example proves that a person can live a perfectly fulfilling life with full amenities (but even that is not completely necessary as Ken explained with co-housing). Housing is most definitely one of the more difficult lifestyle changes that Americans will have to make to prevent the climate crisis from spreading further, but these changes will honestly have the most benefits and remind us all that we don't need that many things to be content

In this week’s lecture video, I feel quite happy. This week the content focuses on the housing and cities. For me, I’ve decide to lease apartment with others. That means that I live with three people in one room, and that’s probably doing a great thing to protect tour Earth. Moreover, we go to campus by one car, which greatly reduce carbon emission. For those who don’t want to live in apartment, I can’t know why. Since having many friends together, we can do a lot of things like playing games and so on. After I hve attended this course, I am more determinant to be a climatarian, like to go to campus by bike, and go travelling by train, indtead of plane. Also, we are changing our lifestyle, like consume more vegitables, and order less doordash.

I’m so glad that you are happy with the apartment life. I myself also would like to convert to living in apartments. It is absolutely a unique experience, like you have mentioned, but I do have some possibilities as to why some people may not be comfortable in that living arrangement. With larger families, it is difficult finding a space that can still accommodate for their lifestyles while still being more environmentally friendly. Also, considering that apartment complexes have a large concentration of people in a central location, the possibility of widespread medical conditions like the flu would prove to be a source of danger for those with compromised immune systems. Provided that, I think whatever can be done possible with housing and city life, like simply using less water and fossil fuel heavy sources, and also the solutions you provided, can do good even without the downgrading of size and living space.

Attending college has introduced me to what cohousing and living in close quarters is like as everyone in the dorms (and apartments) share a kitchen, recreation room, and other spaces with each other. I really value having my friends so close and the sense of community I've formed with my neighbors because of our unique living situation.
     <br><br>


Personally, I find little appeal in oversized homes or “McMansions” as all I can think about is the amount of space to clean, furniture to buy and style, and loneliness experienced when rooms are so far apart from each other. My dream home (I’ve spent a lot of my free time browsing through Zillow) is a quaint, one-bedroom home in Portland, Oregon, with no backyard to water. Rather than following the trend of desiring the largest and most extravagant home, I would want a home that doesn’t rely on everything being in excess for its appeal. A point not mentioned in the lecture that I also have thought about when considering where I’d live one day is that, if you live in a spot that has everything you are interested in locally such as places to hike or good restaurants, you’ll find yourself spending less time at home, needing less house overall, and having shorter commutes to the places you want to go.

While I definitely look forward to no longer living in a dorm as I value having my own kitchen and bathroom, I completely agree that “McMansions” have no appeal. The drawbacks, especially the environmental implications, far outweigh the benefits of owning an excessively large home. As you mentioned, these large homes mean that we feel the need to fill the rooms with stuff, leading to even more unnecessary consumption. A small shared apartment tends to be the norm, and no problem, for most college students so it is hard to imagine that there are people living in 4,000+ square foot housing. I think that as our generation moves on from college we will lean more towards small shared housing and apartments for several reasons. While I am glad that these small living spaces are environmentally friendly, the main reason I will remain living in small spaces is due to the financial aspect. No matter the reason, it is great for the environment if we were all able to transition to micro apartments, tiny houses, or co housing units.
     <br><br>


Something in particular that drew me to your comment was your observation that if we are able to find a community that has everything that we need then we will be less inclined to need to travel. This is something that I find really important because after growing up in a very isolated small town with very little to do I am very encouraged to live in a city. As you mentioned, if we are surrounded with things that we want to do, such as visiting local parks or shops or libraries, then we will spend less time at home, and therefore use less power in our homes. Overall city living seems to be a great solution for many of our problems because it leads to a life closer to other people and further away from the need to buy things.

In my opinion, I sort of see a little bit of irony on this topic. Wouldn't you think that your life would be simpler if you didn't have a car and lived in an apartment as opposed to a house? Sure, the environment of a suburb is simpler compared to the environment of a city, but your life can still be very simple if you do not own a car or a large home. That right there knocks off all the maintenance you have to keep up with for both a car and a house. Many people just see the pros of living in a city, whereas many people just see cons about living in a city and vice versa. But what if we can implement the pros of each and integrate them? "Bring nature to the city"... I think that concept is exceptional and can really bring us all together to fight this battle against climate change as one! We would essentially be making everyone happy in one way or another which would lead to our planet being happy. It's the perfect incentive to get humanity all together to work towards a healthier and brighter future before it's too late.

I've always found the concept of compact housing very interesting. I've seen how in Japan there are hundreds of micro-apartments, which is actually extremely common to live in places like Tokyo. I hate to say it, but these lecture videos are getting harder and harder to watch because I feel like the same information is repeatedly getting addressed. But, I found this video interesting because  I would be interested in living in one of those small houses like Bloomberg addressed. While i do find these small apartments interesting,i have no desire to live in the middle of a busy city. I never have understood the appeal of being surrounded by skyscrapers and buildings on top of buildings, but i realize that that is some people's cup of tea. These small houses make it more accessible for people with a lower budget to still have an amazing space to live in, so i fully support.

I too was attracted to the idea of micro-housing and even community houses because as you pointed out, for me personally that’s my cup of tea. I would consider myself very much a people person so I think the idea of living with more people truly doesn’t bother me especially because most of the time I crave being in a group of people and simply socializing. I can also understand where you’re coming from when you said that these lectures are a bit tougher to watch now that we’ve heard most of these idea before, but maybe the idea of this repetition of these idea is to not only get us used to them but really drive in the concept that it’s very much possible to achieve. I particularly enjoy that Ken never fails to have examples ready of where these ideas have not only already been laid out and put to the test but they’re incredibly successful! And ultimately that’s what keeps me glued to these lectures; it’s the hope and optimism that they bring when everything I’m normally seeing about climate change is so very negative.

I hope that the trend and action of moving to urban areas are only because people feel the need to change their lifestyles but not simply “follow the trend.” Moving to cities can definitely be a solution but the core of the spirit is the most important part. I would say not merely in the developed world, many developing places are popularizing the pursuit of spacious living spots. The real estate market is one of the pillar industries in my hometown. Many young people couldn’t afford a small combo (in America’s sense) in the city even they work hard and live economically for years, for the prices are just so incredibly high for them. But the upper and middle classes are still crazily buying apartments and changing from small apartments to big ones. Children, as the only child in their family, will grow up and have several house properties all over the country, and the huge amount of excess will happen years after. This trend is a cultural problem for my hometown, a developing country. Though my hometown is experiencing cohousing and high-density community life, the situation is getting worse. Perhaps it’s because of the different education level and financial situation from the US, but I believe the most urgent step to take is the shift the intrinsic value.



</p><hr>


<p>
In "Housing and Cities," we are prompted to reevaluate our ideas of cities and environmentalism. As Ken stated, the idea of cities as disconnected from nature and humanity is a strong theme in Thoreau’s works. Western culture has viewed both nature and the city as not only mutually exclusive, but also in opposition. How are we able to find regeneration of the environment in cities that have created large carbon footprints? Ken mentioned this new generation of climate activists and I also agree that cities, or civilization do not create a rift between human and nature. In addition to ideology, this new generation of climate activists are also practical, as we cannot- or at least it is not strategic- to do away with a whole city. It is more strategic to take on what has been already touched by people and find ways to make it regenerative and beneficial to the environment. For example, we cannot just destroy all suburbs just because such city structure is not environmental, we should instead make the city environmental, such as maximize space, etc. In other words, we should not cause more damage to the planet, but instead work with what we have already touched and do our best to be regenerative. 
     <br><br>

One thing that I had in the back of my head during the lecture was gentrification. Ken mentioned that moving to the city would lessen your climate footprint in several ways. For example, there is a trend in building microapartments. Though these may be more environmentally friendly, I think it’s best to reevaluate the motives for building such microapartments in the first place. The reality is that rent is increasing ridiculously high because of increasing socioeconomic stratification. These apartments are not built for the environment, but rather because microapartments are what people can afford. We see a trend in investing in the city, not because of care for the environment, because such investment creates profit maximization, a characteristic of capitalism. In other words, capitalists have moved on to capitalizing off of the city. From my point of view, as there is an investment in the city, people have begun to romanticize it as “urban” is now hip and cool. Unfortunately, part of this gentrification culture includes performative environmentalism, such as moving into microapartments, veganism, etc. In order to navigate the climate crisis, we must also see the motives for environmental acts and not view environmental justice as exclusive to socioeconomic and political trends.

I found this lecture to be really fascinating as I have not given much thought to our society's view on housing. It is crazy that, in Ken's lifetime, the average size of the American home has nearly tripled. I feel like the size of one's house is one of the most sought after portrayals of one's wealth, but many people do not realize the environmental implications. When I think of this topic, I think of the wealthiest people in America, specifically the Kardashians, who have massive homes for very few people, without any real necessity for owning such a large home. People don't often discuss the amount of power needed to heat or cool these homes, or to provide electricity. This lecture also brought up the benefits of living in urban areas, a topic that I had also not considered before. I live in a suburban area at home, and no one ever bikes or uses public transit, unfortunately. Although my city is pretty small, there are constantly cars on the road due to everything being fairly spread out. Because I have never lived in a city, I have never considered the benefits of living there. One of my close friends lives in Toronto, and I remember her telling me about how she would walk everywhere or take the subway, and everything she really needed, like food or other products, was in walking distance. I found this to be really interesting, but super different from what I've grown up with. My sister moved to Seattle a few years ago, and, when I began visiting her, I began to be able to see myself having that lifestyle. When I visited her, we used her car only once, which was to pick me up from the airport as it was pretty far from her house. I stayed with her for almost an entire week, and everywhere we needed to go was accessible through public transit or walking. This experience, along with the facts Ken shared in this video, has definitely encouraged me to seek housing in bigger cities in the future.

I found this lecture to be very intriguing. I have always thought that Americans live in houses that are too big. Most people only go to the same few rooms, meaning that most rooms in a house are barely, if ever used, even if a lot of people live there. It is also important to note that in many major cities in the US and the rest of the world, there is a huge housing crisis where it often seems that there are too few houses for the amount of people who need them. Instead of focusing on how much space a singular nuclear family can inhabit in their McMansion, we could make each house smaller (to a reasonable size where people actually utilize all the space in their house on a daily basis) and focus on ensuring that everyone has a place to live in. I also found Ken's discussion of co-housing interesting. I never really liked this idea since the idea of living with strangers has always seemed off-putting. This is my second year living in dorms on campus and I still can't get over having to share very private rooms (like the bathroom) with people I don't even know and barely see. But there is another way to fit more people into each house while never having to live with strangers. We could live intergenerationally. For most of human history, and in a lot of other places in the world to this day, the entire family lives together. Rather than just the parents and children in one house, everyone from the grandparents, some aunts/uncles, some cousins, the parents, and children live together. This is a very normal thing and makes sense for a variety of reasons. It is practically easier since you have more people to manage chores and errands, but it also fosters a greater sense of community and helps people feel more connected to the people in their world rather than feel so lonely as many Americans and Westerners do. This is also something that happens in many other cultures around the world. My mom's family is from El Salvador and this is very normal there. Instead of children being expected to move out after college, they are encouraged to stay at home until they have a valid reason to move to another city, or get married and possibly have kids--in which case a child must decide whether to live with their parents or their in-laws. Many siblings live together for their entire lives. This may seem weird to many Americans who value individualism over community, but I actually prefer this system and find it to be much more natural and happy for me.

I really like your suggestion of intergenerational living. It goes to show just how many different kinds of solutions there can be to work for everyone. Whether it's intergenerational living, or micro apartments, or co-housing, there are a number of solutions that are so much greener than our current McMansion ideal. Personally, I really favor the idea of co-housing. The idea of living in communal spaces with so many people that come from different walks of life sounds like something I'd really enjoy. I've even dreamed of living in co-housing with all of my friends. It's been an idea that I've considered ever since watching a documentary about Danish co-housing; it just seems like such a nice and positive idea. I personally wouldn't want to live with all of my family, alternatively, but it just shows how different solutions work well for different people, and we don't have to limit ourselves in possible solutions!

Ken mentions here that about 17% of our carbon footprints tend to come from heating and cooling our homes. I am proud to say that I do not own an air conditioner and have not idea how to turn on the ancient heater in my apartment! Of course, I do partake in another 15% of our typical carbon footprint: lights and such in my apartment. Luckily, my home gets good light during the day. 

     <br><br>

It is certainly intriguing to think of a life of urban simplicity as mentioned in the video. Frankly, micro-apartments sound a bit miserable. I don't mind living closely to other people, but I value having a bit of open space in the living room and kitchen. I like the concept of co-housing. As something of a homebody who is far from family, I like sharing meals with my roommates as a way of socializing. I also like the idea of "bringing nature to the cities". Many of us think that "city" is not synonymous with "home-grown". But this merging of urban and rural is not so impossible today. I am hopeful at the idea of green, natural cities. In the past I thought we could live in rural areas in the middle of nowhere and be among nature, or live in  city and be apart from it. I am please at this new imagining of cities and what it means to live in an urban setting.

After watching the lecture video about examples of more eco-nurturing choices in housing, then reading the majority of comments that pose ‘complications’ in doing so, only goes to show that this is just as much as a cultural issue as it is a climate issue. I visited Fiji Islands this past summer and not just the resort/tourist portions of the islands, but more importantly the parts of the islands where natives live and where my mom grew up. The trip made me realize how we take our lifestyles for granted by always wanting more and how wasteful and neglectful the values we base our life satisfactions are. The culture there revolves around the islands. So, I totally wouldn’t mind living in a “micro-apartment, especially after learning how housing alone contributes to our carbon footprint.” (Also, this is a great example of language use this week’s reading highlights, as we call the more eco-nurturing housing option a “micro-apartment, that I feel may have had less appeal to this video’s viewers and commenters.”) I also think that there are a lot of benefits to community living situations that are not as popular compared to “having your own space to call home” in the United States, like energy usage, resources, less time in maintaining a home, childcare, etc. (The states has a more individualistic culture compared to collective cultures around the world, which probably has a big factor in considering this alternative housing option.) Lastly, I think restructuring cities is very important, as Ken mentioned. My three steps to finding a solution are: restructuring our language about alternatives, restructuring our cultural values of life satisfaction, and restructuring our cities. Again, as many topics in this have revealed, we need to start at the cultural opposition to housing and cities, in order to make the most effective changes for the climate.

CO-OPS! Bring nature to the city! This would be so amazing. To have a "blended rural and urban" city, would be what the ideal world would sound like. If we can live peacefully together with ever-advancing technology and community hubs as well as different towns. I think that will be how we can be an effective world as human beings. If we can live in close proximity of each other, then we can learn to see others as humans, create relationships, and care for people. Then this way we can realize other injustice happening in another place that needs help and justice. As a newly developed human being, there could be a desire to help others out in the form of activism. From the video, the best idea is to bring nature to cities, as more architect come out with more background in sustainability and skills at making efficient decisions, they can really make a change in the planning of the development of cities.

I am equally as hopeful and excited to see this come true. Honestly, this should be the American Dream. It sounds so wholesome and lovely. In my short lifetime, I have had the chance to experience a taste of this. I have the privilege of living on campus both my first and second year at UCSB. During my first year, I lived in the classic residence hall--bunk bed with two roommates, communal bathroom, all that. Now, I live in a residence hall with 7 suitemates. We have 4 doubles, a living room and a shared bathroom. I'm still living in co-housing, but I have already felt the difference between this and last year. I do have more privacy and space, but I do not feel like I like the quiet isolation. (Disclaimer: I lean more towards the introverted side of the spectrum, so it's not so much a matter of personality.)


<br><hr>

I am also excited and hopefully for this. My entire life I wanted to move away from the cities and live more with-in nature rather, so the fact that it’s a possibility that nature could be brought to the city, honestly seems amazing. And you’re right I also feel like if we lived in close proximity of each other, we as humans could learn to accept each other as regular human beings and make us realize we aren’t so different after all.
<br><hr>
AGREE! Co-ops are the perfect way to address this issue. Even just living in the campus dorms has shown me the many benefits of living so closely with others and in such a small space. I hope that more and more people will begin to see the value in this, even if that means choosing a small apartment over a large house.
<br><hr>
Yes! I totally agree that we should change this to the new American Dream, that we should change the conversation around money and how to pursue dreams where your goals are not judged by the monetary value. I also think that it is a very very different environment living in the dorms. The student co-ops in IV are kind of a different story and they have their own programming as well as house meetings. I think one really good thing about student/community co-ops is that you have to take care of this shared space (kitchen, bathrooms, living room, hallway), otherwise no one will. This is a lot of times where responsibility comes in. This is probably the most important difference between co-ops and dorms.
<br><hr>
YES. I think that even small spaces like apartments can be helpful in making sure you are making all necessary purchases and eliminating anything unnecessary because you simply don't have enough space. It can really help with practicing (for lack of a better word) minimalism.

It really surprised me that living in cities could be more sustainable than living in rural areas, but when I stopped to think about it, it made perfect sense. Those who live in cities tend to drive further distances less often and may not even have a car, and they live in apartments rather than in big houses. I was also taken by surprise when Ken said that it would be an environmental disaster if everyone in cities decided to move to rural and suburban areas, because it seems so counterintuitive.

The idea of living in an apartment or in a housing community actually seems quite fun to me. Living in the dorms has actually been a good experience - not nearly as bad, or as difficult, as I thought it would be, and is quite enjoyable. When I think about it, I definitely don’t need that much space, and I definitely would never need a mansion. One of my family members, when moving from one house to another, spent about a year in an apartment and actually ended up calling it one of the best places she’d lived. She loved the simplicity of it and not having so much stuff to clean all the time. From my perspective, living in an apartment is actually the most ideal housing situation because it allows you to live simply, save money, and be less overwhelmed by unnecessary stuff, but still have enough space to be comfortable. It’s actually so sad that American culture has trained us to think that bigger is better, because there really is no point to a mansion other than showing off. If we got rid of the stigma surrounding living in an apartment, and possibly even raising a family in one, we could not only help the climate, but live happier, healthier, lives.

This week's video “Housing and Cities,” really helped me look at cities in a new way. I grew up in Beijing, one of the largest, busiest, most populated cities in China. In my understanding, the city is a place of hustle and bustle, consumerism and chaos, with no environmental awareness whatsoever. However, as Ken’s video explains, this is not the case. City living has a huge impact on reducing an individual's climate footprint. In addition, shorter commuting times and smaller housing space have led to significant reductions in natural resource consumption and carbon emissions. In the era of the return to nature movement, people moved to the suburbs in pursuit of a simpler life and more green, which brought huge negative impact on nature. Unpolluted areas are turning into disasters, leading us to think that cities may be the new key to solving climate and environmental problems. As the population grows, it is necessary to consider a new way of life that links people to cities that can accommodate large numbers of people.
     <br><br>

In the future, I would probably still choose to live in Beijing because of its convenience. However, where I am going to live is a small apartment or a sharing apartment with my best friends. I will use my every area reasonably and try to make the house functional.

although I did not grow up in a large city, I agree that I have also viewed enormous cities such as Beijing and New York as environmentally disastrous. I had assumed that the amount of trash and waste produced as well as the massive amounts of smog and carbon emissions from transportation were just causing pollution. However, this video proved me wrong by showing how living in a large city can actually be better for the environment than suburban living. 
     <br><br>
Reduction in commute times and housing space are both things that can benefit the individual as well as the collective. By living in a large city, people would not have to spend so much time traveling in their car from home to work and vice versa. Additionally, a reduction in housing space might actually help encourage a more minimalistic lifestyle as well. I think that the idea of micro-apartments is very appealing as well as mutually beneficial to the individual and the environment. 
     <br><br>
Another interesting point that Ken addresses in the video is the negative effects that Walden had during the 20th century. Many people were more inspired to move out to the wilderness in pursuit of the same minimalistic lifestyle as Thoreau. However, with the massive amounts of people delving into the natural world, this led to the destruction of many previously undisturbed areas. While they may have had good intentions, their disruption of the natural world was actually harmful to the environment.
     <br><br>
By living in closely populated cities, society has the ability to not only reduce their climate footprint but also help the environment in the process. I really appreciated the idea of “bringing nature into the cities” compared to “bringing the cities into nature” because I think that it is something that a lot of people don’t really think about. The idea that trying to become closer to nature might actually cause more disruptions and destruction than we realize. Although not always direct, the amount of transportation and construction necessary to construct a suburban home might be environmentally disastrous.
     <br><br>
This lecture allows the audience to take a step back and reconsider the concepts and practices of housing in our current society. It is important to see the benefits of large cities and to construct infrastructure that can help with such restructuring of our current lifestyles.

Up until very recently, I could not get myself to see any positives to living in the middle of a bustling city. I'm from San Diego, but I live in a quiet, lower income southeast neighborhood, a good distance away from the busier parts of SD. I thought that I would always prefer living like that, but after seeing these recent lecture videos, I'm not so sure anymore. It didn't even really cross my mind how accessible public transportation would be in the middle of a city, or how most people would use that method of transportation as opposed to driving individually. In my neighborhood, almost everybody drives because we don't have many nearby bus stops or bike lanes. To be honest, I had a hard time figuring out bus routes when I got to UCSB because I hadn't ever really been on a bus prior to moving here. Thanks to these lecture videos, I am slowly starting to realize the pros of living in a city as opposed to only thinking about the cons.

I agree with you, I am also from a low income community so people just drive everywhere. I was also unaware of the benefits of living in the cities, mainly because I ruled out living in the city because of its cons. Living in the city can be really expensive and I feel like I would like a home where I can grow a garden and compost on my own. Yes I know that living in a tiny apartment complex helps reduce your carbon footprint, but I think if you live in a home where you can grow your own fruits and vegetables and have your own compost area would also help your carbon footprint. I am still open to the choice of living in the city if it is more beneficial for the environment. It will also allow me to take the bus or ride my bike to work, so that means I do not have to have a car which would reduce my carbon footprint a lot. Also living in apartments is not that bad, you can talk to your neighbors and get to know them better. After watching the video it seems like living in the city does not seem like a bad idea, especially if it helps the environment out.

This lecture made me realize the importance of carbon footprint that’s caused from housing. Americans are fed a capitalistic mindset that purchasing a newer, bigger home is better and what puts us higher than others in social status. However with this mindset we’re really putting massive harm to our planet unless we all learn to implement a more minimalistic mindset that could help us resolve all this destruction from getting too far.

While my parents have always prioritized having a large house that they could entertain guests in, I've grown to value the things I live near more than the things my home offers me. This is an issue that I believe is particularly culturally and not technologically driven. I used to agree with my parents that having a large home was important; I always wanted to entertain friends and such in my home. However, as I've grown older and dealt with both the freedom and the responsibility of driving, I've began to appreciate more and more how convenient it is to live near things like the grocery store, doctors office, etc, and have things like this accessible. I agree that microhousing in cities and making things accessible by public transportation is much more beneficial for people than allowing them to live Walden-esque lives in far-out suburbs. 
     <br><br>
I have grown to realize that culturally, we need to start viewing nature and earth as our home, and our houses as places to sleep. As I've grown into habits that align with this, I've found myself happier and living more environmentally friendly. I value my time more and my living space less; by viewing my room as simply a place to sleep and store necessities, I have been able to minimize the amount of things I own, be more active, and be more in tune with nature. Overall, moving into a smaller space (from my parents home to a triple dorm room) I've learned to value the world as my home and my space as utilitarian.

I love this idea of viewing the Earth as our home and our houses as places for rest. I think that especially with the rise of suburbia in the United States, the house became a central place for gathering, since it is a hassle to travel around the suburbs, compared to cities where everything is compact and near. Large houses can be nice since you can invite many people over and be a host to loved ones, it comes with the downside of being distant from services. Being distant in the suburbs without convenient public transportation means car travel, which, as we have learned, is a huge source of carbon dioxide emissions.
      <br><br>
I think if more people took your advice of valuing time more than living space, we would see a sharp decrease in the market for larger homes. Of course it’s nice to come home to a place that you are comfortable in, and moving to an urban area shouldn’t require you to sacrifice comfort. But it’s the extra space that is unnecessary. There are parts of the house that are barely ever used, as seen in one clip from the documentary on minimalism we watched. Smaller housing also encourages less stuff, and only owning what is most meaningful. Living in urban areas is a big lifestyle change, but it has major benefits for our environment.


<br><Hr>
I totally see where your parents are coming from with the prioritization of having space to entertain guests. One of the biggest things that I think about when conceptualizing my future home outside of IV is having space to have friends and family over. For as long as I can remember my parents have always hosted family for holiday events and friends for birthday parties or school functions. Because of this, I really value being able to host as I feel like it really is the easiest way to get all the important people in my life together. 
      <br><br>

On the contrary, though, I really enjoy living in urban places and have gotten used to the smaller living space that comes with it. I also am very intrigued by the tiny home movement and am open to the idea of the micro-apartment. Maybe it'll just take some rethinking of where social gatherings could happen; instead of entertaining at home, we can plan more trips with friends and family outdoors. I definitely don't see myself living back in a suburb like I did growing up.

<br><Hr>
I completely understand where you are coming from as my family has always encouraged me to go to college so that I could buy a big house and have my own car and be able to care for them and my future family. For many of us it is the same or similar case. It is a cultural view, at least in my case, that having more stuff puts you at a higher level of success, especially where you live. Just like you, I was always agreeing with them and would take in criticism of what I am supposed to make of my life. However, growing more independent has taught me a different reality that a house is just a house. A car is just a car. Stuff is replaceable. Many tend to take importance of the things we have as where we are in life and the rewards of our accomplishments. Happiness doesn’t tend to be taken into account and it creates a big issue of our own self-reflection. Today I am able to walk or bike to where I need to be instead of having to drive everywhere to be able to do anything. Despite not partaking in micro housing, having freedom in being able to do things on your own and being so close to places makes things so much more easier on you and can relieve a lot of stress. In fact, it can build stronger relationships with those around you and allow you to appreciate the smaller things in life.

After watching this week’s lecture video, Housing and Cities. Ken Hiltner’s suggestion of co-housing communities could be a solution or serve as an alternative to reduce our personal carbon footprint based on our housing. I found this solution to be challenging and hence, a possible source of that challenge could be broken down to by viewing the concept of an ‘American phenomenon’ or the ‘American culture’. In detail, humans will always live off their preference and not by a simple suggestion by the community if not backed with reliable facts. To exemplify, dormitories in colleges for first year students could be seen as a co-housing situation in which students share rooms, kitchen, bathrooms, and etc with  other different students. Although it would be nice to think that co-housing or the idea of sharing spaces with other people will reduce our carbon emission, this will be difficult for everyone to adapt because of the unique way each individual lives their lives. Ever thought about a public restroom? Do you recall how dirty it is? This problem could be seen as a con and could also be a starting point of different cons that may trigger discrepancies within society.

As the professor noticed before, living in a small apartment can help decrease the CO2 emitted. People saw cities as environmental nightmares and instead fled them for the suburbs. But some suburbs in China, they burn coal and drive cars to go to the city to sell vegetables, meat, and other stuffs. They raise pigs, cows, and chicken in the suburbs. I think the people living in the suburbs, actually release more CO2 than the people living in the city. People who worked in the city take subways and buses to go to their workplace. But in the suburbs, people drive cars which burn diesel that emitted more air pollution. Also, in the city, because the price of a house is expensive, people would choose to buy a small house, like micro-apartments. This is also a way to help the planet. According to the comparison between cities and suburbs, I think living in the city sometimes can help solve the climate crisis more than living in the suburbs. I live in a suburb once before; the people burn coal and pour the dirty water into the river. They don’t know what climate change is, they don’t think they also cause pollution because no one taught them the problem of the climate crisis. 
      <br><br>
I think we need to improve education, spread the solution about the climate crisis, and invite more people to join the team to protect the environment.

In this day and age, wealth is measured by the size of your materials. In the beginning of this lecture, Ken gives facts and statistics. 1 in 5 U.S. houses are around 3000 square feet. McMansions are 1/10th of the houses in the U.S. and are over 4000 square feet. Meanwhile Japanese homes can hold families of 4+ people in 400 square feet. Supersizing has definitely expanded in addition to the idea that bigger is better. I always see a ton of social media posts that showcase big houses as goals, these excessive spaces virally being claimed as goals. This has brought a detrimental effect to our environment. Our energy use within our homes can emit greenhouse gases. This can relate to heating and cooling or other energy related appliances, such as lighting. My parents do not like to use our heater or air conditioning because of costs. They would open the windows if it was hot or prompt us to wear layers and blankets around the house if it was cold. Though their intentions were for financial reasons, they still helped save our environment all while being frugal!
      <br><br>

I think living in UCSB has also opened my eyes. Not just taking this class and becoming more educated on the climate crisis and ways to mitigate it through personal action, but through the ways UCSB is eco-friendly. For example, I dreaded having to live in a dorm. I was so bummed out that I could not have an apartment already, but now I appreciate my one room space. I thought I needed more room, an apartment, a single, but dorming has helped me make a friend right off the bat and taught me to be minimal and conscious of my space. It showed me the beauty of co-living.
      <br><br>

I just really want an efficient home when I raise a family. I thought owning my own home would be the way to go. To an extent, it is optimal. You have a whole house for your family after all! A driveway, kitchen, rooms, common area, and etc. You only have to worry about volume to an extent. However, the more I thought about it, the more I realized that you can have this with an apartment. It’s more space-efficient, cheaper, and leads to less clutter. I have been considering living in a city as well because I want to be a human rights lawyer and my law firm would probably be in the city. I believed I would get a home in an hour away, in a suburban area, and would need to commute every day, but even living in the city could be beneficial. Greater access to public transportation and less travel time from city to city means less time wasted.

The lecture “Housing and cities” has taught how important the negative effects of housing are. The Average American home is over 2500 sq. ft, which is more than 2 and a half times larger. What is crazy is that family sizes are actually smaller nowadays. That means that there are leftover space. Homes release a lot of co2. 17% of the average American’s footprint comes from heating and cooling homes. 15% comes from the energy used at home. Ken points out that transportation, housing, and stuff are twice as more important than food. He points out that the co2 released by building a home is like counting the amount released when creating a car. So just manufacturing those two things in the first place is a major problem. Ken brings about the idea that solving this housing issue involves moving to a micro apartment and considering co housing. He also adds on that greening cities is also a great approach. In my opinion, living in a micoapartment does not seem crazy as I am not a fan of spacious rooms. I actually really enjoy being a small room like I am now. I also would not mind sharing a room with someone. I think that this change would be hard for some people but with slow progress anything is possible.

Living in smaller rooms is not only more enjoyable for some, but also necessary in attempting to lower the per capita carbon footprint (in terms of housing). The several methods that we can take that Ken brings up in his lecture are definitely feasible, and much more convenient than Thoreau's idealistic lifestyle in Walden. For instance, the Adapt NYC Program places everyone in relatively small houses that limits the per capita carbon footprint while also providing people with the necessary elements that are required for city living.
      <br><br>


Cohousing is also a good option for not only cities, but also suburban and rural communities. If people were to come together as a community rather than practicing carbon-emitting habits individually, then it would also lower the per capita carbon footprint. Take the many Amish communities across the country, for example. For every meal, they tend to congregate as a community and eat together, rather than make their own food on their own. They also resort to the bare minimum in terms of necessary housekeeping operations (hand-washing/drying laundry, wood fireplaces, etc). Obviously not many people would like to strip themselves of the privileges they already have to live this lifestyle, but I believe that we must take inspiration from communities like these in order to lower the carbon emissions that come from housing.

The lecture this week on "Housing and Cities" gave me a new perspective on why large cities give people the chance to reduce their carbon footprint. I grew up in Los Angeles, and always wish I would've made greater use of public transportation such as busses. However two years ago, my parents decided to sell their cars which left me motivated to figure out the different systems of transportation. With this, I found that the metro in Los Angeles is a completely effective way of traveling. In addition to reducing my footprint, I also save tons of money on parking and gas. Taking the metro has also exposed me to different neighborhoods of the city I was not familiar with. 
      <br><br>
While I still do live in a moderately sized house, I do look forward to moving into a micro apartment after college. I choose to have very few belongings and prefer a space that is not cluttered. Knowing that by doing this I would reduce my carbon footprint gives me even more incentive. It's really a shame how we live in a society that has an addiction and obsession with materialistic objects. More does not equal better. In fact, when it comes to belongings, I think more equals worse. I've visited Denmark a few times now and have seen the co-housing they have there. It's not surprising to me that so many people in Denmark are happy. I believe that by having fewer objects, living in smaller homes, surrounding yourself with house mates, not only is great for the environment but great for ones well-being.

Also like you, I have lived in Los Angeles basically my whole life. I had always thought that living in a city where pollution and population grew had always been bad for the environment before watching this lecture video. Im glad to have learned that places like LA actually are important for decreasing your carbon footprint. As people live in smaller and smaller spaces(in larger cities), it makes sense that these are so much better than living in a super-sized home. 
      <br><br>
I feel as if many people are against the idea of living in smaller and smaller spaces. I really wish I could do something to curb the idea that living in a large space could actually feel much more isolating than a smaller one. Although every person is different, I feel as if living in a smaller space with less "comfort" items can actually decrease your stress. Living in a closer space with people you like can be fun, as you arent setting yourself up for isolation and can increase overall comfort from others. You arent constantly worrying about where all your things are and also arent craving the next "biggest thing" coming out. I feel this can give you much more of a reason to feel content about your life and encourage you to get out into the world more. I really hope people see the benefits of living smaller, instead of always following the trend of buying big. I believe that buying bigger and bigger can leave people isolated and create a pattern to always want more and more.

I've lived in Southern California for all my life, and I can literally count the number of times I've been on public transportation. I'm extremely surprised that the "the metro in Los Angeles is a completely effective way of traveling," because everyone seems to think that public transportation is terrible in California. The fact that it's Los Angeles that has an effective form of public transportation is especially shocking to me. After all, traffic in downtown Los Angeles is infamous. It's funny that I, and many others, would be surprised at Los Angeles having effective public transportation, since public transportation being good in an area that needs it due to the population density should be normal. Our culture is abnormal. Driving 3+ hours daily to and from work isn't something people should accept. 
      <br><br>

Yet, we accept huge houses and scorn living in close-knit communities. The majority of people would choose a huge mansion over co-housing because of how we're being trapped by our culture. Being cultured is seen as good, but it also means that we're constrained by our culture. It's not our fault that we've been blinded by our culture, but it means that we'll have to deliberately try to see beyond the lens or blindfold that has been placed in front of our eyes. Even though I've seen examples of co-housing being great and full of happiness, I currently wouldn't choose to live in co-housing, due to personal reasons (I'd consider microapartments though). In general though, I feel that people would avoid microapartments or co-housing for the same reasons they avoid sitting directly next to other people in public spaces.
      <br><br>

 Also, I still remember how Minimalism (I think) mentioned that a larger house means more distance to walk. If some people are lazy enough to not get up to grab a TV remote, why would they want a huge house? Instead of paying someone to clean your huge house, why not save money on a smaller house?

I've always found the concept of compact housing very interesting. I've seen how in Japan there are hundreds of micro-apartments, which is actually extremely common to live in places like Tokyo. I hate to say it, but these lecture videos are getting harder and harder to watch because I feel like the same information is repeatedly getting addressed. But, I found this video interesting because  I would be interested in living in one of those small houses like Bloomberg addressed. While i do find these small apartments interesting,i have no desire to live in the middle of a busy city. I never have understood the appeal of being surrounded by skyscrapers and buildings on top of buildings, but i realize that that is some people's cup of tea. These small houses make it more accessible for people with a lower budget to still have an amazing space to live in, so i fully support.

Compact housing has always appealed to me as well, and I know I don’t need a huge house to live comfortably. But I know people who would only feel satisfied living in a large house with more bedrooms than residents. I think that it’s unnecessary to waste so much space on one person’s living quarters. I wouldn’t want to live in a building surrounded by other tall buildings and have a brick wall to look at through my window, so I wouldn’t say that everyone should live in places like that. However, I think we need to change the American idea that bigger is better, so that less people will be taking up over 2500 square feet of space for their homes just as a show of their success.

I get what you're feeling towards the videos. The videos are kind of like iPhones - each new one has something "new" and "refreshing", but it's basically the same thing. But yeah I agree on how smaller houses can be great. The only problem is that the main people I see that are associated with those homes whenever they're getting promoted are people who are well off financially. I hardly see minorities in the videos. Yes the smaller homes should be more accessible along with able to accommodate a lower budget, but Ken should also realize that there are a bunch of minorities who are basically living in "tiny homes" in the cities, simply because they aren't able to afford anything else. It's difficult to make people reduce their home size when it's already small enough, on top of the fact that they yearn for something more in life since they've been at the bottom their entire lives. The promotion of these homes are indirectly shattering many peoples' dreams of a better life.

As Ken said, 86% of the average American's carbon footprint comes from housing and transportation, and the best way is to move to cities. However, like I said before, moving to a city can only solve the problem temporarily. Encouraging everyone to move to a city, yes, people will live in a small house and use public transportation. But do you think about the long-term effect? First, cities have their maximum occupancy. Once they reach their max, there will appear new problems. Meanwhile, if everyone moves to cities, who will develop the suburbs? This action will only cause the inequality between suburbs and cities. Lastly, not every city has a complete system of public transportation. Think about Los Angeles, I believe it is a city. However, is its public transportation good? Absolutely not. I’ve lived in LA for two years, it is hard to see bus stops and subways. I’ve talked about the problem of moving to a city, I deeply remember what my friend said, “Americans don’t need to move to cities, they just need to create cities”. Her words just express everything in my mind. No matter improving public transportation, or building more apartments, creating new cities is the key!

The average size is over 2500 feet? Why do we think we need so much space! It is lonely. One phrase my friend likes to live by is take one for the two of us. This is evidently very broad. But the idea is sharing. Each person on a block does not need their own loan mower. We can share amongst neighbors. Another example is sharing clothing with family members and friends. This phrase is utilized quite well living in expensive California going to university. For two years I lived in a room with  three people. Right now 7 of us live in the same house. This cuts down on our electric use of course, as well as well as the fact that we share clothing, jewelry, materials, cooking and much much more. We all talk about how it is nice to always have people to come home to, it makes it not lonely. I would definitely consider living on a commune, to always live with people. Or if I am living with less people I definitely want to live somewhere smaller and cozier.

While I do not think that I will be moving into micro housing or co-living apartments, I think it is important to reduce the size of the average American house, which is currently happening.  When you look at a heat map of a person and the amount of time they spend in each room, it is astonishing how little room we actually use.  Even my  house in suburbia, which is relatively small compared to my most of my friends' hardly gets used.  I can think when four people were living there, there were two room that almost never got used, and two more that were used lightly.   Now that me and my brother have moved out, There are 5 rooms that I doubt are being used heavily on a daily basis.  I could not imagine how much worse this would be for houses twice as big as mine, which are not uncommon.  We have to move away from this idea that bigger is better.  Bigger houses to me are undesirable.  I would much prefer to have a smaller house and a larger yard, as that gives you more connection to nature, and greater flexibly on what to do with the space.  However, according to an article by business insider, 2015 was the peak of the average American house size at 2500 square feet, and since then it has dropped.  This is due to many reasons, one including tiny houses and unnecessary down sizing.  It is clear that our society is moving away from the 50's American dream of a McMansion with a white picket fence, to a house that fits the needs and wants determined by the family and the individual, not social pressures and keeping up with the Johnsons.

The co-housing concept of living style is pretty effective for reducing the personal carbon emission and natural resources, since people share the public area in a relatively smaller space. I personally like living in a small apartment or space, with staying in a smaller area, it really helps me to try to know the people living next to me. Nowadays, people do not know their neighbors quiet well, I am sure that way can get the old feeling in the childhood that each neighbor knows each other. 
 <br><br>
And the city, the big city cuts the feeling of nature from our living environment. The all things we can see from our view are buildings and bigger buildings. We cannot easily escape from the city vibe since it costs the carbon emission, too. So, the existence of plants is crucially important for human. It not only brings the ideas of decoration, but also the natural energy in the life. It just like giving people a way to relax a little in the busy daily life.

I was born in New York City. When I was only 4 years old, my family moved to the suburbs east of Los Angeles. I’ve gone back and visited NYC several times in my life. Now that I go to school at UCSB, I’ve realized that I really am a city person. Even if it’s only the suburbs, I thrive living in city environments and while I see the merits of less populated places like Goleta, with vast expanses of nature nearby, I feel stifled by these environments. Even going to downtown Santa Barbara isn’t enough to replicate the enjoyment I get from being in bustling cities with lots of people. That’s why I know for sure that once I graduate and look for a job, I want to do it either in Los Angeles, New York City, or another similar place. 
 <br><br>

So it makes me glad that living in a city can actually be one way to reduce your carbon footprint and live a more eco-friendly life. It’s true that in a big city center you’re a lot more likely to use public transportation instead of driving around everywhere in a car, and I think this is more substantial than most people might think at first. After all, going to places such as work or the grocery store is something that people do almost every single day, most definitely every weekday when it comes to work for the average working American. The difference between doing that traveling by driving a car everyday versus utilizing public transportation, a bicycle, or other environmentally friendly means of transportation, is huge and can really make a difference over the course of many years. 
 <br><br>

The notion of ‘green cities’ is something that has always fascinated me. It’s the perfect kind of living environment for me personally. A large, bustling city but designed to be environmentally conscious and eco-friendly: like proposed city models with skyscrapers that have terraces to grow plants out of, or having large public works here and there for the purpose of having some more nature in the city. Central Park in NYC is a good example, in my opinion. There’s just something so amazing about walking around in a natural environment, surrounded by trees and green grass, but looking around and also seeing the city skyscrapers in the distance. Places like Central Park are vital for any city, I think, because they provide that outlet for people who may get stressed or feel claustrophobic from always being surrounded by a fast-moving, high-energy city environment. If there is a large city that also incorporates a very large amount of natural elements like big parks, lots and lots of trees, terraces with growing plants, etc, I would move there in a heartbeat.

New York City is one of my favorite places I've ever been to! I love walking around Central Park, it's such a beautiful part of the city, especially for someone like me, who definitely needs to be able to see some nature in my everyday life. I'm from Oregon, where it's very green, so I really appreciate it. I think cities are great in how cars are not as necessary as they are in suburbs. In that way, urban living can reduce one's carbon footprint greatly. I like the idea of a "green city". However, there is something about suburbs that I really loved while growing up. Kids being able to play with their friends in the streets, knowing your neighbors, neighborhood parks, feeling safe, etc. I think suburbs are good for family living, so realistically, it would be hard to convince families with children to move to cities.

This week’s lecture helped me change my preconceived notion that cities are harmful for the environment. I am now able to understand how cities can be a solution to the climate crisis. When I thought of cities, I thought of pollution, traffic, and concrete rather than trees and clean air. After this lecture I am able to see how cities can be beneficial to reducing individual carbon footprints, people live in smaller spaces which is already a huge part in reducing the carbon footprint, as there is less space to heat in the winter and cool in the summer. More people use public transport for daily traveling, for example it is notorious that people in New York city don’t own cars simply because using the subway is much quicker, cheaper and overall more effective. More and more cities are making green buildings, rooftop gardens. I wasn’t expecting this but I see now that moving out of cities can hurt the environment more than help it.

Much like you said, I also would immediately think of pollution and traffic whenever I thought about cities. I had been strongly opposed to the idea of living in the city because of those exact reasons, but I've come to see that living in a city can be beneficial to the environment. Like we talked about, co-housing and microapartments are getting more popular, and I've even seen a few advertisements for co-housing structures/microapartments that promote sustainable lifestyles for their possible tenants. Seeing those make me think about how much of my carbon footprint would get reduced if I were to move to a city after college, and so I've broadened my perspective on that.

I personally think that as a culture we must not glamorize living in massive houses. I think that too often people think that this is a show of wealth and it proves one's worth. However, this just leads to a space way too big to be reasonable and way more expenses in the upkeep and monthly bills such as electric and gas and whatnot. I love the idea of cohousing too, as this means that many people can share spaces such as living rooms and a kitchen, providing for a better sense of community and also helping the environment. For myself, I love to be next to places that have a plentitude of nature, and so while I love how sustainably huge cities are, I could only see myself living in one if it was a green city that stressed the incorporation of nature into the closeness and efficiency of a huge city. I think that we should really try to reconcile nature and cities so it does not have to be so much of a one or the other situation. In New York they took an old train track that was not being used anymore and turned it into a very long narrow park, with many plants and places for people to sit, and I think that if cities incorporated more of these more natural features, then I would be more inclined to live there. I could not stand to stare at brick and iron all day, and I only feel calm and happy when I can be immersed in nature, and in some cities that may be hard to find.

I think moving to a city and living in a micro-apartment or cohousing community Is a great idea. The only issue is actually being able to adapt to this type of cultural lifestyle change. We American’s have become accustomed to what is “bigger is better”. Although housing makes up 32% of our climate footprint and 55% percent of the world’s population already live in an apartment, I do believe for most it is not by choice. I am not against the idea; I just personally wouldn’t make the switch from a home to an apartment or city unless my career would require me to make such changes. I do appreciate those who are able to combine a rural and urban lifestyle in the city, I think these changes are making the lifestyle more appealing

I agree with you that it would be great for the environment to live in micro-apartments or community housing. College students do this all the time, and, as Ken mentioned, many people in Europe do this as well. The only problem with this is that many people will refuse to do so because they can afford to live in big houses and they think it’s what they worked hard for. As Americans we are taught that “bigger is better” and that we should all strive to live lavishly in huge homes. This is again the “American Dream” that many people look towards as they try to make a living. As we start nearing the housing issue that affects the climate crisis, many people will have to sacrifice their mansions, but will not do so without putting up a fight. 
 <br><br>
	Another thing I found interesting about this video is that cities are actually more environmentally friendly compared to the suburbs. Cities reduce the use of cars and put people in smaller homes. It is difficult now to think that cities are worse for the environment than suburbanity. Major cities depend on public transportation as the main way to get around, which means lots of people are not driving cars. People in cities also live in apartments that don’t require as much energy to maintain. Cities are able to house millions of people in a smaller or equal space to that of a town. Everything is so packed, people don’t have a choice. A lot of people also don’t mind it. I’ve always dreamed of living in a huge house, but this video has made me question why I even want a big house.

After watching this lecture video I began to realize that living in a city isn't hurtful to the environment but rather beneficial when compared to the suburbs. I had always assumed for some reason that cities were emitting large amounts of greenhouse gases but in reality, they don't emit as much as suburban towns. I guess I had thought this because of how polluted the city looks from afar. Being from the South Bay, a coastal area on the outskirts of L.A., I can see the brown smog that surrounds downtown Los Angeles. It makes sense as to why a city would emit fewer greenhouse gases than the suburbs. With the amount of necessary driving being close to none in a city, the carbon footprint of those who live in there drops dramatically. On top of that, most people living in cities live in smaller, more environmentally sustainable housing. I appreciate the movement to bring greenery into the cities as I know it will be environmentally favorable, but will also make cities more aesthetically appealing. I hope Ken is right and two - thirds of the population will live in cities by 2050. If this happens we may be on a much better track in avoiding environmental disasters.

I always thought that city life was harmful to the environment because of cars and the skyscrapers. However just like you I can see why it is more beneficial. When my parents moved into this country my dad's plan was to move into Fresno and basically get a house in the middle of nowhere. My mom shut down he idea because she did not like the idea of being far from city as she was going to be forced to learn how to drive. They ended up moving to LA for the convenience it had. Life in the city made it easier for my mo to move around without the use of a car. So I do see it making sense for city life actually helping the environment. There are schools, hospitals, parks, grocery stores and jobs closer to home that do not require a car.

This lecture discusses housing alternatives to the large square foot houses that have become a prominent commodity of American culture. Co-housing and micro-apartments seem like such an interesting concept to me and are definitely housing options that I would consider in the future. Currently, I'm living in a university residence hall and next year I'm going to be living in a university apartment. These spaces are much smaller than the typical suburban family homes that we find in Goleta but they ultimately end up housing around the same or even more people than what would be found in a typical family home. 
 <br><br>
The belief that the city is an environmental disaster and people must flee back to nature in order to save the world is an outdated view that quickly needs to change. If people were to move back out into undeveloped nature, that area would be disturbed and destroyed because the space would need to be cleared to build homes for people who are moving out there. Instead, solutions need to be found within cities to house more people at affordable pricing so that people will not have to commute to get to work.

I liked this video a lot because it discusses a lot of the ways we contribute to carbon emissions just by living in our homes, with the construction alone adding about 80 metric tons! Even if we add solar panels and limit our meat consumption, it’s going to take a lot to balance out the emissions. What Ken said about smaller and more efficient housing is something that I had thought about, but the community aspect of it is a new idea to me that I really like! A future of close knit communities living in one building that could house hundreds of people, decked out with greenery as Ken describes with the green metropolis, sounds like something I would love to be part of. The agricultural applications through community rooftop gardens and even small areas for livestock would allow us to minimize the vast amounts of space we use for them already. 
 <br><br>

Civilization does not mean a division between humans and nature, we can see a blending and coexistence and it is becoming a requirement. We have to turn towards eco nurturing and restoration of the spaces we’ve destroyed or industrialized. A mere back to nature impulse becomes a detriment to nature as  hundreds of people flee to the country to rural areas but end up creating suburban areas. A green utopia of shared communities that rely on a common space for food and power would not only eliminate waste and create eco-friendly alternatives, but will also positively influence communities to work together to sustain themselves.

This week's lecture video made a lot of good points and while the emphasis was put on cities, I think suburban neighborhoods should be held to the same importance. I recently interviewed the program director of Cool Block here in Santa Barbara and they give neighborhood action plans to become more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly with your neighbors. Seeing as Ken was emphasizing community housing, this is trying to bring the community back to the neighborhoods and stresses collaboration with the people who live around you. Cool Block is launching an initiative this year to make Isla Vista completely carbon neutral by 2025. So with something like this already happening, why not get even more ambitious and form farms or greenhouses for neighborhoods to share and cultivate together. Based purely off diffusion if the inner city starts bringing in nature, soon the outer communities will join and then a city can be green from top to bottom.

After listening to this lecture and hearing Ken once again mention the micro-apartments I immediately thought of the minimalism film where the guy lived in a micro-apartment. I thought it would be super cool to live in one of those.  Especially considering that about 32% of our carbon footprint comes from our living spaces, it would be advantageous to have a place like that to help us cut down on personal emissions. 
 <br><br>
I am also curious to know what other methods Ken uses to cut the emissions from his home besides those that he mentioned in the video.

Yea, after listening to this lecture it reminded me of one of his previous lecture videos where he talked about how the space per person in an American home is much larger than that of a typical Japanese home. Once again it provides us an opportunity to be more conscious about our living arrangements and how we can be more minimalist/conservative with it.


<br><hr>
It seems pretty ironic how cities serve as a model to reduce carbon footprint when as mentioned in previous lectures they have a large carbon footprint themselves. Apartments in cities really do provide the essentials in living while minimizing the amount of space taken up. And micro-apartments as you mentioned really do seem pretty cool as you have everything you could possible need in a small place. It’s just so satisfying to see how every inch of space is used conveniently for a comfortable living style. This reminded me of the study where they tracked how frequently the rooms in a house are used. Many times people have three living rooms or two dinning rooms when in reality they are hardly even used. With this in mind it seems logical that apartments or smaller houses are a good alternative as you will be paying for the space you really are using.

These new ideas for living are very important because they provide great solutions to major problems. In the U.S. many people live in way larger houses than they need to be living in, and I am apart of those people. Now, I do really enjoy my house, but to be honest most of the rooms are unnecessary and are not used very often. I, as most people would assume, did not buy my house or even have any say in designing it or anything, that would be my parents doing, so therefore after I took English 22, I tried to inform them of these facts. They love their house and did not really want to hear me out that our house is a big cause of our carbon footprint, and yes they do care for the environment. Yet, the fact that they wouldn’t give up their unnecessarily large house to save the planet is a generational problem. They have learned that having a big house and filling it up is a sign of success and they enjoy having “their space” even though half of it is unused. But for me, I think I would enjoy living in a small micro-apartment or co-housing area. I think these solutions are great ideas that offer people of my generation a solution to multiple problems such as economic, environmental, and could maybe even help with mental health issues. These mental health issues could be such as stress which comes from economic issues or leaving with people they don’t like and more. I have lived in a suburb my whole life, and I do really enjoy it, but living in a city would be really cool and would be very convenient. Furthermore, suburbs are a huge issue and cause a lot of pollution due to transportation and the ability to live in large houses, while also taking away land for agriculture and other such productive activities. In the future, I could definitely see myself living in a micro-apartment.

This is my first time hearing how cities can also be transformed into a eco-friendly environment. Cities are generally associated with pollution, overcrowding, depression and many other negative connotations. Indeed shorter commute and less natural sources needed are more convenient and beneficial, there are many other problems with a working life style in cities. Overcrowding is a problem for example, anxiety and depression in a confined space can also be an issue for the people living in small housing. 
    <br><br>
I think living in cities will be feasible and environmental friendly, but as a species on Earth, the interactions between us and the nature is indispensable. This might require us to re-think what a city should look like. “Bringing nature to cities” can be a solution to this, as we can design our cities in a way that is more natural. This may also require us to change the way we work and our corporate environment, as the constant working and meeting is one of the defining features of a city.

I think a lot of people would agree about your statement about how cities are being commonly connoted with pollution, overcrowding, and the other things you just mentioned--even myself. But looking back on my time living in San Francisco, although sometimes walking the streets there would be so much litter, but I also knew that SF was big on recycling unlike other places I lived which were suburban areas. I also think it's an amazing idea that cities are incorporating green. I remember looking at something back in elementary about how cities should incorporate gardens on their rooftops to "go green." To add on, co-housing sounds like a great idea, more people living in one house which benefits the environment, but once again as I have stated in other comments, I feel like because our society in the US is very materialistic and "bigger is better," the idea of sharing a space with another family could be a turn off. But where we can start is to not have a family/couple of 2 or 3 own a giant mansion, but I would be more understanding if big family owned a big house, but again, this goes back to minimalism. It truly IS possible to live in a somewhat small house with a big family--sharing rooms with siblings and not having extra rooms such as a game room or movie room, etc. would help. Just typing this all out, I feel like would sound completely radical to a lot of people. I hope that slowly but surely our society can go from favoring a materialistic/bigger is better life to a more minimal and simplistic way of life.

The current week's talk video, "Lodging and Cities," genuinely helped me to see urban areas with another lense. Growing up only outside of San Diego, perhaps the biggest city in California, my concept of a city was one of clamoring individuals, industrialism, and confusion, with no feeling of environmentalism at all. Be that as it may, as clarified in Ken's video, this isn't the situation; city living can be incredibly significant in lessening somebody's individual atmosphere impression.
       <br><br>
 The entirety of our decisions have a type of either negative or beneficial outcome on our condition, and we have to begin contemplating these impacts when settling on choices in our lives. There is quite a lot more information and developments that are circumventing the world that are entirely feasible and simple switches that have numerous constructive outcomes for nature, similar to the modest house development, or co-living. I truly preferred all the living recommendations that Ken gave inside this talk and furnished me with tips to follow despite the fact that I realize I would prefer not to dwell everlastingly in a major city. I currently live in my van so the combination of living in a van in a city seems intense for my own well-being to be completely selfish about the situation but I do think I am minimizing my carbon footprint by how frequently or ...not recently I shower and drive!

These are all super cool points, Ivy! I totally agree with you about the inherent assumptions you made about city living in California. I would have never associated city living with being environmentally progressive. It is interesting to see how modern developments have beneficially impacted living in a hustling city and being a quarter away from graduating and moving to a big city of my own, I am excited to delve into all that cities have to offer, both environmentally and beyond. I thought it was relatable (and a bit comical) that selfishly you would not reside in a big city for a long amount of time. Although I definitely understand where you are coming from and recognize that everyone has different living preferences, I was wondering if you (or anyone seeing this) would be more apt to big city dwelling after this modernization period dramatically changes what it means to live in a city-- how it looks and feels. I, myself, know this is seems like a confusing question seeing as though no one fully knows the potential of such adjustments to modern city living. But as Ken mentioned, there seems to a monumental shift in how cities and its infrastructure are being constructed and that, in turn, is influencing how people operate and view themselves in a city. I am curious to see what you think, and even more curious to see how this migration back to cities plays out on a regional and international scale.

I had a similar perception of city living, however that's coming from someone who grew up in the countryside isolated from everything. I had an idea from film and media, but never a genuine knowledge of it. I thought you were more environmentally friendly all connected to nature and whatnot, not surrounded by city lights, but it seems that's not the case. I also always had this perception of living out in the middle of nowhere was my ideal life as that's what I've grown up on. I'm realizing that's no longer what interests me, living in a tiny home or even an apartment actually sounds appealing having become more informed. I too think that overall though, co-living actually sounds fascinating, someone I would once hate fervently, but now have some sort of an intrigue. Oh, the power of knowledge.
<br><Hr>
I completely agree with you. I had the same perception of cities: crowded and industrial with no feeling of environmentalism at all. But Ken’s lecture made me see the immensely positive things that come from living in a city. Downsizing can greatly reduce our carbon footprint. The fact that approximately one third of our footprint comes from energy to power our homes is crazy! Just by living in a micro-apartment or a smaller place in the city, you can lessen your atmospheric impression by a large amount. The amount of carbon the average American emits just by owning a home exceeds the amount they should be expending annually to prevent the 2 degree rise in temperature. City living not only lowers our emissions because of downsizing, but it also decreases car use. Cohousing goes even further by sharing services and amenities with others. I hadn’t heard of this option, but it could be a cheaper, much more environmentally friendly option especially if I decide to live in a city as a young adult. 
       <br><br>

I also liked the idea Ken described of greening cities. This movement to bring nature to cities is beneficial for many reasons. The cities are the most developed places on Earth, if we can make them more energy efficient it will have a huge impact on our planet as a whole. That is where the majority of our population resides and where the majority of carbon is emitted. Greening these areas is a brilliant idea.

Actually I feel kind of proud of myself and my family after watching this video. I live in a very small house that perfectly accommodates three people and a dog. From the generation of my Grandma, we were educated as minimalist, or in other word, “thrifty”. My grandma encourages us to recycle as much as possible, like recycling water, bottles, and plastic bags. Although not from a perspective of climate crisis but a traditional virtue, I have formed a habit of consuming as little as I can. 
       <br><br>
What I want to say is that an eco-friendly way of life should be passed on generation to generation, as a habit, a thing that is to be praised. In some places, packing up unfinished food is a habit to most people, but in other places it is seen as stingy. We should start to build up families that allows people to take minimalism as a normal habit rather than a thing that we must force ourselves to do to protect the environment. When most people have accepted minimalism, consumerism would be something to be despised and not recommended. There also an economic way, putting money into saving and investment instead of consumption also helps minimalism. In a lot of East Asian countries, saving and investing is more favorable then spending, and that’s part of the reason that most Asian countries are generating less carbon emission than the United States do.

I like your idea and the connection with Asian culture. It is true that Asian culture tends to spend less money, unlike Americans, Asian tend to waste less. I agree with the idea that less wasting should be passed on generations by generations. It is never a story of one single generations, instead younger generations and future generations should work more to help. I think your house idea that we do not need space we do not need. We tend to buy so many things that we actually do not need. It is sad. Come to the topic of housing, famous basketball player Shaq" O'Neal said " he has a house of 14 bedrooms and 15 bathrooms. But he only uses one of them" This example shows that it should not be about how much money you have, it is really that we just do not need that much. The money you save up from not buying things you do not need will eventually culminate up to a large amount and what is the best that it will not make our life worse because we do not use them anyway even we buy it. It is a win-win both financially and ecologically.

<br><hr>
I agree with your comment and also find pleasure in minimalist living. As mentioned in my previous comments in this course, I am not attracted by the lifestyle that always yearns for more things out of one's reach. I suppose that the "white whale" in this context would be a large house instead of a small apartment; however, unless the extra space is actually needed by significantly more people, a large house is frankly just expensive, inefficient and wasteful. 
       <br><br>

My parents and grandparents grew up in difficult times when not everything was available in bountiful supply; in fact, they rarely purchased any red meat, and even had to survive the winters with only cabbages and coarse-grain carbohydrates. While it is undeniably good that we can enjoy a more balanced selection of foods and live under significantly improved conditions, there is no excuse for our current generation to be frivolous in how we consume. One must not view the case for small houses as an infringement of personal freedom, but rather a sustainable approach to save our humanity from the brink of overconsumption.

The change of housing size in the US mentioned by the professor is very considerable. There is a huge difference between the average size of under 1000 square feet for an American house in the 1950s to the size of over 2500 square feet right now. I think the saying that “bigger is better” is very much true for Americans. Because the US has a relatively great area of land, it is not hard to build or afford big houses, and companies don’t even bother to build houses with many stories (since they don’t need to worry much about land). 
       <br><br>

I really like the professor’s idea of the merging of country and cities, which might appear to be two opposites at the first glance. A new group of activists are shifting their attention from the nature untouched culture to the idea of a green metropolis. Since the US is already a developed country, it doesn’t need to worry much about the basic needs of its people and has the choice to think much about what the society can do in the long run.

I am really intrigued by the ideas spoken by Ken in this lecture video. Usually I wouldn't pin living in a bustling metropolis with doing what is right for the environment. In fact, I feel like i'd be more secluded from nature and the environment from living in a city. I guess it also goes hand in hand with the idea of the American Dream in this country; one makes it big in their career, they make money and then they move out to the country to live in a big house.  I completely understand that want to get away from the grime of real life one usually equates a big city with. One wants to achieve this sense of peace of mind and retirement from a life of labor and work.  Sadly this sentiment also contributes to the dangerous culture of owning way more than we need. 
       <br><br>

I'd like to imagine a world where after we have moved into a housing system where living and housing becomes a more efficient, eco-friendly endeavor in places like big cities. Not only this, but instead of using mass expanses of land for animal domestication, industry, or suburbia, we use this land to cultivate the earth in ways beneficial to fighting climate change (new forests, eco-friendly agriculture, animal preservations etc.) Through this I believe that we would still be able to have that same escape to an area with peace of mind and retirement that one can achieve by owning a giant estate. 
       <br><br>

I know it all sounds kind of corny, but it's just a thought of what we could achieve after fixing housing in our cities.

I understand that micro apartments and just smaller homes would be very helpful to help mitigate the climate crisis, but to me that does not sound nice. I know that changing the environment will require sacrifices, but this is an extreme change that would completely alter the fabric of how society works. With the inclusion of more cities and more populated cities things such as disease, crime, city infrastructures etc... have to be considered. It reminds me of the dystopian movies where everyone lives in extremely close proximities and it turns into slums. Ideally, the cities would be clean and have nature, but this is easier to plan than to actually put into action.  

       <br><br>

Another problem if people were to move into cities and these micro apartments has to do with jobs and what would happen to the physical houses themselves. If, per say, people were forced into living in micro apartments in the future people would likely not be able to sell their houses or still have to pay mortgage on the property they no longer live in. This is an extreme case, but it is something to think about when talking about moving people into cities. Many jobs are based in cities, but many people are able to find work due to suburban areas being less populated, but jobs are still needed.

The idea of micro houses/apartments is definitely intriguing and could very well be an answer to part of the climate ciris, but I am interested in seeing what downsides it could potentially bring.

I can see how living in the cities would help in the climate crisis after watching this lecture. However, it is not something we, as ordinary people, can do whenever we want to. People who live in the city spend thousands of dollars on the convenience they get, the transportation, the café that crosses the street, not everyone can do the same thing. At the same time, people living in smaller places due to the higher rent. I believe, with enough money, people are still going to buy cars (otherwise there won’t be traffic in New York City), live in huge houses, have a super high carbon footprint. If everybody realizes that living in the city would be good for the environment, and all of them start moving into the city, the spending on every aspect of life would go up, which, I think, none of us want that. What, I think, we should be trying to do as a whole is to increase/upgrade public transportation, build more apartments instead of big houses, and the government could have an incentive mechanism, which encourages the people to live eco-friendly. In other words, I think we should create our own cities, instead of moving into a city.

Another interesting means of reducing one's climate footprint. While I understand that everyone has the right to reside in whatever living environment that they feel comfortable in, an average American family living in a place over 3000 square feet seems just a little unreasonable. It all goes back to the cultural shift that Ken repeatedly mentions throughout the course: Americans, if not everyone, need to learn how to be content with having what they need instead of obsessing over what more they could have. Not everyone may be ready to live in co-ed housing settings, but everyone does need to understand the positive impact of minimizing the space that they occupy only to what is necessary. Growing up in Los Angeles, the only "green" aspect of my city were local parks, so I'm curious to know if initiatives for local urban farming would be possible in my city. As counterintuitive as it may seem, the thought of reducing everyone's climate footprint within an urban setting is an exciting concept.

America has definitely and successfully sold the idea that "bigger/more is better" to developing nations, which is concerning. My parents grew up in poverty (think one room for 7 people to sleep in, no heating or air conditioning, kitchen is straight up outside the building kind of poverty) and one of the biggest things that they were proud of, before studying up on the climate crisis, was the fact that they could afford to own several cars and live somewhere with multiple rooms. It saddens me to know that areas that we should especially work on cutting down on (housing, transportation) have a great deal of "embedded carbon" that the average consumer does not really have a say over, whereas something that we can more easily control, such as diet, is a mere 14~16% of our footprints. City living has never really appealed to me because of the air and how crowded everything is, but what Ken said about "bringing nature to cities" rather than leaving cities for nature interests me.

Living in LA has made life different than a lot of other lifestyles. In LA, if you dont have the newest name brand things or a big house or apartment, you dont necessarily fit in. I have a 2000 + square footage house with avid meat eaters and a very consumer based family, the AC is always on and cars that use way too much gas. Yet as I continue pointing out ways the lifestyle of my family is detrimental to the environment I get ignored. "we need a big house for our space" or "do you want to be hot in our horrible summers?" and my arguments get dismissed faster than I can process this. Los Angeles county is huge, with way more cars than necessary and public transportation has a very negative stigmatic because of the grand homeless population. Microapartments seem effective and cozy but factoring in kids seem hectic. The dream is to have a big backyard so the kids can be outside and play in a pool and enjoy the outside but the argument against micro apartments seems so small when the Earth needs us to make changes. It also gets frustrating when I think that traffic makes using cars horrible, why not encourage public transportation in LA? 
       <br><br>

Even including plants and animals in the suburbs not only save money but encourage less consumerism. Urban and suburban farming is our old state, why not grow your own food and save money and decrease the costumers for large markets. Encouraging our natural lives and timing seems to be the most popular version of a problem but when you want to make something happen, it will. We need to appreciate and use up the best parts of the space we take up. Even living in cities can be environmentally conscious so excuses are not acceptable anymore. We can no longer dream the American Dream because the Earth cannot afford that.

I found this lecture video to make me much more optimistic about the future.  Moving to cities is a very promising way to reduce carbon emissions as it forces a change in one's entire lifestyle.  Therefore, pursuing this solution would result with many other environmentally alternatives following natural in one's lifestyle.  For example, if you move to a city, you drive less, maybe there is more food that is produces by environmentally aware companies, the city is powered by more renewable energies than other areas etc.  The choice in where to live can affect a wide range of environmental factors.  New architectural designs such as the ones found form Bloomberg's Adapt NYC project also provide a promising future as these designs could lower the cost of living for many so people can live more environmentally friendly while saving money.  The marketing of environmentally friendly alternatives is very important.  Bringing nature into the cities is also another promising aspect of the future.  Not only will it create a more sustainable area, but it will improve the living space and make more of the public want to move to the cities and enjoy living in the cities.  I'm sure that cities will continue to try to become more environmentally friendly and less expensive as they would want more people to move in so the city earns more money and can improve more.  Cities are one of the most promising solution as it is a naturally marketable environmental solution as people earn money or improve living by this means of being more sustainable.

When I first think of cities, I do not think of living in one as being environmentally friendly. Often, they are busy, hectic, smoggy, and a lot of cement. It feels very far away from nature often. It was interesting to find out that living in a city is actually more environmentally friendly than living in a suburb or rural area that would be closer to nature. However, on reflection it makes a lot of sense, as living in the city usually involves smaller houses and less driving. 
       <br><br>
Growing up I wanted a large house with a pool, however now I am more open to a small house or a nice apartment in a city. This will allow me to lessen my environmental footprint and not have to drive far to work. 
       <br><br>
I like the concept of tiny houses; however, I do not think that most people can practically live in them. For many people it would be a huge lifestyle change and probably think it is very extreme. I think a more practical solution would be to build more affordable housing within cities and try to push people to live closer to city centers.

It really is surprising that residing in cities leads to more environmentally friendly lifestyles than suburbs or the countryside despite how removed it is from nature. But, after hearing about it from the perspective of the resources that are limited in city life, I now see how cities can be desirable for people who want to reduce their carbon footprint. It certainly will be a more realistic alternative than moving towards, say, Thoreau’s cabin.
       <br><br>
I also agree that my view on living in a city in the future has changed. I have always just wanted to not be in such a crowded area with so little space; but having realized that a large house is actually unnecessary and terrible for the environment, my previously-ideal lifestyle plans no longer seem wise.
       <br><br>
I can see how people will not accept living in a tiny house and I like the idea of promoting housing in cities.


<br><hr>
I agree with you. I was really surprised hearing that living in a city is more environmentally friendly than living a suburban or rural area, because when I think of cities, I think of smog producing factories, a bustling night life that is far from the environmentally friendly lifestyle, and trash/litter everywhere. I didn't plan on living in a city because I thought that it would be less environmentally friendly than living in the suburbs but now I am considering it after hearing that it is the opposite. 
       <br><br>
I also agree with you in regards to tiny houses. I went to Japan before, and saw how tiny their houses were. Even though the houses in Japan had everything I needed in a more compact space, which is better for the environment, I felt cramped because it was not what I was used to in America. Switching from the big houses in America to the tiny ones of Japan would be a huge life style change for me, which is something I do not think I am comfortable with.

Ok once again I am going to have to bring in this example. Just because the majority of people are single or only with 1 or 2 others, a 250 square foot apartment is just ridiculous for a family to live in. While I do agree that we need to downsize the house in this day, there are things that need to be taken into account. My dad grew up in suburban Illinois outside of Chicago with his 5 other siblings and 2 parents. Their house wasn't massive but 2 stories nonetheless. I have been in that house many of times and it boggles my mind how 8 people got around that table in the kitchen or fit into the bedrooms that they shared with one another. If they had lived in a house that was any smaller it may not have been functional whatsoever. Functionality is a huge thing to look at and every single thing besides diets has honestly seemed like a measure that would make people less productive. I really wish this class would look into more venues of thought because more and more this class is frustrating me.

On a side note, these northern European countries you constantly bring up as socialist are not very socialist at all. According to an article by Forbes, They are welfare-states in that the high taxes that everyone pays allows for well funded government programs. These countries have no minimum wage and people get good wages due to powerhouse unions. A majority of these countries actually rank in the top 20 in the world in terms of free trade with little government intervention.

Ken mentions that 17% of our carbon emissions for the average american comes from heating and cooling their homes, this includes refrigerants. Another 15% comes from other uses in the home like lighting. That is 32% of our carbon emissions is coming right from our house. Ken says that using solar panels and adding insulation is not enough to help reduce our carbon emissions. I'm sorry but when I get older I still want a decent sized house, I don’t want a house that is obnoxiously big, one room for each of my kids and one for my wife and I is just fine. The only thing I really care about is if i have space and that can happen in I consume less materials. I want land and that doesn’t emit carbon as much as a house which is still a win form mwe and the earth. Cars and flying are responsible for  28% of carbon emitted by the average american. Ken says that having an electric vehicle is not enough but i was thinking what if we run these electric vehicles with renewable energy. Make vehicles that have solar panels on the top of the car so it charges up as we drive or as we let it sit out during the day. People are still going to be using cars so I think this could work. The Only carbon emitted from the car is when it is in production. Another 26% of our carbon emission comes from our materialistic consumption and the last 16% percent comes from food. This is why I don’t think that going vegan is really necessary just because it is such a small fraction from the rest of what we do.

After watching this lecture, I must admit I was struck by a profound sense of guilt and opposing ideologies within my mind. I am someone who places a huge amount of weight on personal privacy and personal space, and so as you might imagine a living condition even like the triple dorms at UCSB is less than ideal for me. But I also place a large amount of value in the idea that each person ought to do anything and everything they can to contribute to important initiatives and issues larger than themselves, the most important of which is obviously the climate crisis. As I listened, I wondered how I could possibly hope to reconcile the two opposing tendencies in a way that would allow me to both have the privacy and space that I want while also contributing little to the climate crisis without unnecessary space. What came to mind, interestingly enough, were the sleep pods popularized in Japan. These small things, in lieu of full hotel rooms, were essentially tiny bunks in a human-sized pull-out drawer that took maximum advantage of available space, with chargers, personal TV's, desks, and comfortable beds in a tiny tiny space. I realized then that the solution to the issue might be a renewed focus on innovation in interior design: the thing that allowed these sleep pods to enable privacy while also minimizing useless space was ingenious interior design - soundproof walls, TV's in convenient built-in places, chargers where they're most useful. There doesn't have to be a large loss to quality of living if we just spend more time and brainpower into improving the structures and systems of living that we already have.

I went through the same thought process as you while watching the video. I am currently living in a triple dorm and while I enjoy my roommates and don't mind it most of the time, there are definitely times that I just wish I could have my own room and privacy when I need it most. This is why Ken's recommendations of living in a communal space with a communal kitchen or bathroom sounds so unappealing for me even though I know it will lower by carbon footprint greatly. I know some people will be able to live in these communal spaces but in my future I just don't see myself being able to do it. As you said, there are ways that we can minimize space and as long as it's a private room for me, I don't mind having less space to myself. As Ken mentioned in the lecture, I always think back to Thoreau about how simplicity in life can bring us happiness. I hope in my future I can follow this doctrine and even if I do make enough money to buy a bigger and bigger house, I believe I will be able to accept a simple life in a smaller residential house in the city. I'm not going to go to the lengths of living in communal housing because it makes me uncomfortable, but I am going to work with myself in a way where I can maximize my sustainability while living in a way that is comfortable for me.

I don't think it's a problem that's hard to understand. It is obvious that without cities our environmental problems would be worse. Why don't we imagine that there are seven billion people in the world, if there are no cities, and these seven billion people are randomly distributed in every corner of the land like nomads? We don't consider whether the land is livable first. Such a wide population distribution is enough to have a greater impact on people's living environment. Because there is no city or community that brings people together. People's activities are more extensive and people's impact on the environment is more obvious. So I agree with the view of the video that the city is not the main cause of environmental damage. In fact, our environment will be worse without the constraints of the city, so I think what we need to do now is to make the city as environmentally friendly as we can.

When he mentioned that life in Manhattan is far greener than in Wyoming, I was a little bit shook. I totally was that person who thought that life in cities like Boston or San Francisco was detrimental to the environment and living in places like Wyoming where it's more isolated was eco-friendly; now that I think of it, I couldn't have been more wrong. There are a variety of factors that make city-dwelling way better for the planet than living in the suburbs. It does seem counterintuitive to think of cities as green because they appear as the ultimate form of eco sabotage-- ripping up the planet to build buildings, apartments and what not, and making it completely void of nature. While it is kinda sad to think about the ecosystems that were destroyed in the process of developing a city, they are there now and its vital that we focus them and other areas that we have already developed so that we can save the wilderness that is left. Being a young college student, I find it exciting to try out new living spaces that may be more environmentally friendly. In a lot of cases -if not most - living in eco-friendly housing alternatives would be cheaper. The idea of spending less on housing while "saving the planet" and having more money to utilize elsewhere seems like a win-win to me.

Like you, I was surprised at the now obvious fact that cities, when planned properly, can have a healthier environmental impact than a typical rural lifestyle. In addition to that, I am also still fascinated by the concept of cooperative housing. I think that co-ops and, to some extent, compact city housing have a unique ability to make environmental progress a plainly communal effort. Not only are people living in those spaces actively reducing their footprint, they are able to do so in a shared manner. I think that the gratification that can come with that communal factor plays a huge role in the intrinsic value of our living situation. If we are able to both commit to beneficial change and do so in a way that makes it a truly shared experience, people who make the change will likely be that much happier about having done so. In response to Ken’s revisiting Walden, I agree that it is interesting to see some of the closest resemblances to Thoreau’s model occurring in cities like New York. At the same time, and again referring to your original point, that is really one of the most important things we can do: take advantage of city-spaces since they already exist.

This video truly inspired me and allowed me to have a wider perspective of what my future could be. Growing up I always thought I would live in the suburbs and settle down to have a family, aka live the “white picket fence”  life. Our world is constantly changing and so is the culture around housing and sustainability in our everyday lives. I really enjoy the idea of co-housing and community living. I feel like I  could definitely consider moving to a small apartment, but co-housing had never even been in my realm of thought in terms of my future living situation. Now, living in the dorms in a very small space has been challenging, since prior to the dorms, I lived in my own room back at home and shared my bathroom with only my sister. After living in the dorms for a while, it has proven to be a much better living environment than I expected. You learn the importance of compromise as well as making the most of a small space. I always thought I wanted a big house with a big backyard, but now I am definitely reconsidering my future living decisions, not only for sustainability reasons but the idea of co-housing seems like such an enriching and lively experience. 
       <br><br>

I think that the “American Dream” makes us believe that to be successful and happy we must live in a big house and buy what we want when we want it. The sustainable, minimalist lifestyle has a stigma around it that makes it seem like you would be living off of the bare minimum but in reality, the “bare minimum” is more than enough to yield a life of happiness and contentment. The lack of material goods allows for more time to focus on family, friends, meditation, and the beauty of life and nature. The cultural shift back to cities and urban life can transform not only the bad habits of our society that plague the climate with carbon emissions, but the mindset of our society to one that is mindful of our climate.

I had the same thought too while watching this! Co-housing is actually not that bad of an idea, especially after living in the dorms with someone you click well with. Being able to share a space with other people has a lot of benefits in one's personal life, like being able to socialize and help out each other for homework, chores, etc. And of top of this, it is better for the environment and makes you realize that a large house is not very necessary. I really like how you said that you learn the importance of compromise and making the most of a small space, because living in the dorms definitely taught me this and made me more efficient. As the new generation will start to buy houses and have families soon, we can reinvent the idea of the "American Dream" into a place where you feel comfortable and can call home, instead of just a huge place to symbolize wealth and success.

It is interesting to see Ken bring back up Thoreau and Walden Pond. Once again, Ken reiterates that he believes the most important part of Thoreau’s legacy, at least as applicable to the climate crisis, is that Thoreau reflected and got rid of everything unnecessary in his life. Ken brings up the idea of smaller apartments, and perhaps even co-housing. I must admit … despite being content with my current ~130 sq ft dorm room which I share with two other people, I cannot see myself doing this as a permanent living arrangement when I get older. The idea of communal kitchens and cooking sounds … questionable at best to me. I’ve had similar experiences with co-housing and communal cooking when I visited my grandparents back in India-- but I’m having some kind of cognitive block imagining myself doing this with non family members. Ken brings up an interesting point of eco-sabotage vs eco-nurturing. I wonder if a moderate take on this will be enough to enact widespread change.

As someone who has lived in a moderately sized house for the entirety of my life, I never saw the point in larger mansion sized housing. I grew up around many upper-class and middle-upper class families. There's a huge region in my hometown that has been completely cleared out to fit mansions and manors for thousands up upper-class residents including rapper Snoop Dogg. I recently visited Japan and was a firsthand witness of their small housing spaces. To me, the decreased housing space seemed extremely cozy and comfortable. The fact that i can effectively reduce my carbon footprint by decreasing my housing space seems like a huge win-win to me. Not only am I able to save on housing costs, but I can also do my part in mitigating climate change. 
       <br><br>

I like how this lecture brings attention to the many problems facing American housing. As our population increases, we need to build more affordable and efficient housing. Downsizing seems to be the solution to three of the biggest struggles in America. In doing so, the cost and carbon footprint of these houses can be effectively decreased  while also leaving more space for more housing projects to be created. To me, the idea is a no-brainer and It is super confusing to me why these plans have not been enacted on.

I agree with you that it is a great idea to reduce our housing space in order to reduce emissions. Throughout my entire life, I have always wanted to move to a big city such as New York when I grow up. After watching this lecture video, I realized that by moving to a city, I can reduce my carbon footprint because not only are commutes shorter, housing is smaller, and there is less consumption of natural resources and lower carbon emissions. Throughout the video, I was shocked to learn that the building of an average home emits around 80 metric tons of CO2 and other greenhouse gases.  Many people may see cities as very overcrowded and overpopulated, which leads to smaller living spaces and less room for unnecessary goods. This connects back to the idea of minimalism, by reducing the amount of space that we have, we can reduce our consumption and emissions. The section in the lecture video that I found the most interesting was the part where Ken focused on co-housing and urban farming. I think that co housing is a great way for people to reduce their emissions, however, I think that people value their personal and private space and would not be willing to give that up to live with many other people. A more reasonable option would be to reduce the size of homes and moving to cities.

The idea of living minimalistically in a small and sufficient home is very interesting to me. Although I admire big, grandeur houses, I have always had more of a desire to live in a little, homey apartment where I can surround myself only with the things I need. Now more than ever I feel a pull towards this kind of living space, even if that means living in the center of a bustling and energy-rich city. Along with many others, I have always stereotyped big cities as dirty and overcrowded, a place only meant to visit on a day trip with friends. However, after watching this lecture, it is clear that city planners are putting in an extreme amount of effort to shift the perception of what a city truly is (or should be), adding plant-life and even agriculture into the scape. 
       <br><br>

As I am not sure if I see myself having kids in the future, it has not been something I have worried about to wonder whether or not I could raise a family comfortably in such a limited space. However, one thing that living in a triple-person dorm here at UCSB has taught me is that no matter how limited the space is, and how much stuff each person may have brought along, you can make it work if you have to. Prior to living in the dorms, I would have avoided the thought of communal living, as it just seemed too close-quarters for comfort. Now, however, it doesn’t seem all that bad, especially after factoring in the planetary benefits. Although I, personally, am in support of living in smaller spaces in a city-scape, I do worry that my desires might be uncommon, making it unlikely that others will want to do the same.

This week's video mainly targetted housing and how it affects the climate. Interestingly enough, I found it quite strange that housing itself would cause Americans about a quarter of their allowed carbon footprint per year. Perhaps it stems from the idea that I've never lived in a new home, or that the carbon footprint really comes from the appliances that come within the house, but I never would have imagined that a house would make such a difference. Regarding the idea of co-housing, I've seen a couple of co-housing communities popping up around UCSB, and it seems similar to dorms albeit with a communal kitchen. Having shared a room with as much as three siblings at one time, I've grown used to the idea that living with people is normal and honestly at times it's comforting. Thus, housing such as this is not only a great way to personally help combat climate change but grow together with people in your community. Add in the idea of minimalism and solar-powered roof panels and housing can start to grow in a positive method.

The video talks about the impact of increasing housing sizes, however, it is not surprising to see as the population is also increasing. Housing size has become an issue because I think people idealize having a big house as a sense of financial stability. Also, some people see a big house with a big backyard as an image of a perfect life. Which shouldn't be the case because some people require less room than they actually need. I also found it surprising that housing accounts for 1/4 of people's carbon footprint. As most of it comes from appliances that are in the houses, and the ones that are required to keep the house running. It makes sense because as houses get bigger people want to fill it with more furniture and bigger appliances that require more energy. Thus, it is beneficial that houses get smaller but also change into a more sustainable energy source. As mentioned in the video, putting solar panels is a beneficial way to reduce the carbon footprint that houses will normally produce.

I think co-housing could be a great way for people to reduce their carbon footprint and be more environmentally friendly. Modern houses keep increasing in size and cost while family sizes and wages are staying relatively stable. It would be a great way to reduce resource wastefulness as well as help foster stronger communities of people. The amount of appliances would be reduced and resources shared, creating a more green way of life. If your family is too big, or you value personal space too much to co-house, I believe more modest living is a great alternative. I can guarantee that whatever house you have pictured in your mind for future, it can be smaller. People associate smaller living spaces with clutter, poverty, and crampness, but it doesn't have to be. Living in a small house has many advantages over living in a large one; they're cheaper, easier to clean, require less maintenance and most importantly, have a much smaller carbon footprint. And it doesn't necessarily have to be a tiny micro house, living in simple and modest means goes a long way.

I found this week's lecture video, "Housing and Cities", to be very eye-opening and insightful. For example, 32% of the American climate footprint comes from our houses. Compared to transportation and flying, which comes to about 28% of our climate footprint and our incessant need for stuff which totals at 26%. Before watching, I was aware that our transportation trends and consumption focused lifestyles were a large part of our increasing GHG emissions, but I didn't know that our homes, where we take refuge and find comfort, could be more detrimental than our actions. After watching, I can see how this is the truth, but it is almost disheartening to hear that not only how we live but where we live needs to change. 
       <br><br>
I also learned about the embedded cost of carbon in our homes. In other words, around 80 metric tons of CO2 and other GH gases are emitted into the atmosphere when the average home is built. This number adds to the average person's carbon footprint and therefore, the average American is using over 2 1/2 times their total annual carbon allotment on their homes. This then leaves nothing left for our cars, clothing, and all of the "stuff" we consumers need to buy to fill our homes. Although there have been several solutions created to reduce our homes' carbon footprints, it is clear that they won't be enough. 
       <br><br>
As Ken explains, the best thing we can do is move to a micro apartment or co-housing community and this can easily be done by moving to a city. I agree that this can and will be beneficial to those who make the move, but I also agree that it is important to have a connection to nature. Living in an urban city, or “concrete jungle” so to speak, to me sounds very unappealing. I don't mind living in close quarters or with other people, as that is what I am doing right now as a resident on campus. I also plan on living in a small apartment in Isla Vista next year, with five of my friends. I could see myself living this way, apartment style with roommates, for the next few years but I don't think I could go without being close to nature. The close quarters and small apartments that make up Isla Vista are balanced by the beachside cliffs and the randomly placed parks on every street. If I moved to a city, I would hate to look out my window everyday and only see grey. I understand this may sound selfish or inconsiderate of the environmental benefits city living has. Therefore, I think if we do make this switch, it is essential for the creation of rooftop gardens, city parks, and trees planted on the streets. I am sure I am not the only person who feels this way and I think this could be a concerning factor for several other people.

After watching this video and reading your comment, I noticed that we had similar thoughts and I agree with lots of what you have to say. The lecture video we watched this week had similar themes that I have heard previously in English 22. I remembered how much moving to the wilderness would affect the climate for the worse, but I forgot how important it was to stay urban while improving the city life space usage. With American going over the average carbon footprints for housing, we need to change the culture around micro-apartments and how beneficial that can be for individuals with saving money and the environment. You make a great point about how close the living is here in Isla Vista, but with the parks and beaches and color that is here, it makes life much more enjoyable and easier to deal with. If we incorporate ways of getting greenery into urban areas, and make this more of a focus,  then people will be more willing and happier to live in micro-apartments. Co-housing communities are the future, with American culture needing more change and focus on this even if it were to be temporary.

This week's lecture video focuses on the importance of our housing choices when it comes to our carbon footprint while offering ways to possibly change our culture. As a student and as someone who is thinking about my own future housing situation, I have really thought about the way I will live in the next five or even ten years. In taking this class things have changed for me. Now I think about making housing changes that can reduce my present and future carbon footprint.  Knowing how housing impacts our carbon footprint, we should all consider our housing options for the next five or even twenty years of our life. Another way to approach this is by thinking about how these housing options can impact our neighbors and friends. 
       <br><br>

When dealing with the climate crisis, I feel that many times the housing issue is not brought up like other factors such as our diet or consumption. Yet, like all of our actions, living in a more environmental-friendly option is one of the ways we can contribute toward change, and the answers are present, like choosing a city home. Housing has grown into a problem in this country, from people wanting larger homes that better suit their dream lifestyle, of having everything perfect. As we have seen and learned, the housing culture has led toward high CO2 levels, and in order to change this, we have to implement cultural change.

I agree with your opinion. In the next few decades, people will think about whether to change their lifestyle. Twenty years ago, people thought of cities and big houses as their only goal, because that was a symbol of social status. However, now and in the future, when too many people come to the city and large houses affect the environment that releases too much carbon dioxide, people begin to rethink what environment they are suitable for living in. Count urbanization now seems to be one of the trends. People began to return to the suburbs and enjoy its quietness, rather than endure the hustle and bustle of the city. However, I think that it is personal freedom to choose where to live. We can call on everyone to implement counter urbanization, but we are not qualified to ask others to do so or to sneer at people who do not do that.

I found this lecture very interesting. I think the idea of micro-living would not be hard for me to do at all. I would be good at living in a small space that has just enough room for what I need. I also like the idea of having a communal kitchen (as long as it stays clean). I think it would be a good way to form a community and even cook for each other when wanted. Overall, I think that the current size of a house an average person has is way too big and unnecessary. With that said, I have to admit that city living doesn't seem that appealing to me. Being close to everything and not having to commute or use cars would be great. I see the benefits in city living but I just feel like people that live in nature and have the ability to go hiking, climbing, surfing, camping, etc. in the fresh air will have a hard time committing to city living. I do think that there could be an in-between that would work, maybe doing some small city living instead of just relying on places like Chicago. I do also like the idea of bringing green into the city. I was a couple of examples of this in one of my other classes and they were really cool, which is why I think it’s a great idea.

I also liked the idea of living in a mini apartment in the city. The idea of living with other people in close quarters isn't that scary anymore as I've gotten used to it in college. But the idea that city living in greener is very counterintuitive and difficult for me to wrap my head around it. City living also sounds quite expensive to me and many people purposefully move to the suburbs to find cheaper housing. City living is also stressful for some people and detrimental to mental health. I'm sure that in the future city life will probably look different than it is today, hopefully we can move away from the idea of a concrete jungle.

While I do agree with your sentiments in this lecture about why people should move to the cities, there are some ideas that I can't wrap my head around. I think it would be great to reduce everyone's climate footprint by moving into smaller apartments and move in with more people in the cities. It would greatly reduce commuting time, which would limit the amount of cars in use and thus reduce the carbon output. 

       <br><br>

I have multiple problems with more people moving into the cities, however. The first problem is that there could be overcrowding as a result of this sprawl to the urban areas. This overcrowding could push people back out to the suburbs because they would be uncomfortable in this lifestyle after living so long in the suburbs. Diseases would be spread much quicker with everyone being so close together. However, say that these people stick it out and stay in the cities. The people living there now could be priced out and forced to move away due to gentrification and overpricing. My final issue is what happens to the houses and all of the infrastructure in the suburbs. We have cleared out so much land in order to make these houses, what will happen to them? It would be a waste in my opinion to destroy all of the houses, restaurants, and schools that have been built outside of cities just to get people to move back into urban areas.

I honestly cannot say I fully agree with this weeks lecture video. I have pretty much lived in a city my entire life, and it is for sure not by choice. I do like that everything is very close and accessible, but city living is soooooo expensive for such a small apartment. Some people have the privilege to choose to live in small apartments, but some people are forced to fit 7 people into a small ass apartment. If I had the ability/the money/ the opportunity I would for sure without any thought get my family out of the small city apartments and into a larger house. That is the dream. I know we talk about changing the American dream, but this is one dream that is not changing for me. When you live in a one bedroom apartment with 4 siblings and your parents for your whole life, an apartment in the city is NOT the dream.

This lecture allowed me to see how cities are really not bad for the environment, like most people believe. I have to admit that I always believed that big cities such as NYC and LA had the biggest carbon footprint because of the many people that live there, however as I went through this video I realized how much more sense it made that cities don't have that big of an impact. If you look at a city like New York, most people walk places or take public transportation, such as the subway, which in suburban areas people drive around everywhere, just because it os harder to get around without a car. I think that this is very good for cities, but for suburban areas there should be some other type of public transportation implemented which gets people places easily without having to use their cars. 
       <br><br>
As for housing, I completely agree with what Ken says. I think that it is ridiculous sometimes how large the homes are for families of only 3 or 4 people. Ken mentioned that houses have been getting larger and families smaller, which is something that should not be happening. The truth of the matter is that small families do not need homes that are so large. This only creates a bigger negative impact on the environment and is extremely costly for the families itself. I feel like micro housing is a good idea, specially for people that live fast paced lives in cities. This is because people that live life that are really not at home and do not give it much use. They usually only come home to sleep and occasionally cook a meal, however living in a micro home can be much cheaper for them and better for the environment.

In this week's documentary "Being the Change," the director Peter Kalmus talks about his experience living in a city. He talks about how disconnected he felt from nature. He knew about the harm we were causing our planet, and the urban environment he was living in only added to his anxiety. He didn't mention being apart of any co-housing communities or green rooftops like Ken discussed in this lecture. If Peter, who was environmentally conscious and had an extremely good education wasn't able to convert to a green lifestyle in an urban setting, it's hard to see the masses switching. One complication that stands out to me is cost. Many others in the comment section have talked about the price disparity between a small apartment in NYC compared to an average sized house in Texas. The small apartment is around 3 times more. I think selling the idea of buying smaller for more expensive would prove challenging. Granted you would save some on transportation and a few other things, unless the cost of housing in urban areas decreases drastically, it's hard to imagine these co-housing communities being anything more than a minority. Despite this, the idea of the urban lifestyle Ken talks about in this lecture has been intriguing to me. It seems cool to at least give this lifestyle a try. The transition from my house to the dorms was easy than expected and honestly a lot of fun. I see the appeal of the lifestyle but I'm not sure I would be able to fully commit to such an undertaking.

All my life, I have lived relatively close to a big city, growing up near San Francisco, and now living in Santa Barbara, close to Los Angeles. I have always loved cities, but only to visit, and cannot see myself settling down in a city with a family. I have always characterized cities as dirty and crowded, but have never really considered the great environmental impact I could be making if I lived in a city. I feel like everyone around me is always talking about how they dream of living in a huge house with modern technology and a big family. I have never asked about the idea of how much we would all be hurting our environment if we all bought mega mansions.
       <br><br>
I liked Ken’s idea of rooftop gardens, backyard chicken coops, and vertical farms being ways to bring nature to the cities. All of these ideas seem like fun ways to be a bit more environmentally friendly. In addition, this proves that you do not need to give up some of the things that bring you happiness in order to live a more sustainable lifestyle.

In the past, I saw cities as a place full of people who had large carbon footprints. I now know that they actually have smaller footprints than the people living in the suburbs. This motivates me to move to the city even more. I was scared that living in a city would be bad for the environment, but now that I know this isn't the case, I can see myself living in a city. I don't want a big family anyway, so this would work out perfectly for me. I also think big houses are ridiculous. Most of the time people don't even use all of their rooms. If I do move to the city I would love to start my own rooftop garden so I could grow my own food and still be close to nature. Another good thing about cities is public transportation is very common.


<br><hr>

Honestly, I have never really seen the appeal to wanting a huge house with countless empty rooms. Even though I didn't want to live in the city, I always imagined myself with a tiny and cozy home. However, now I know that even my imaginary small house would be harmful to the environment. As I've gotten older, the idea of living in an apartment has become more and more appealing, and the recent lectures in this class have solidified that appeal.
<br><hr>
I understand your original concerns about living in a city, and can relate to them. I think that city living has gotten much more normalized and almost glamorous in the past few years. I think I might be able to live in a city in between college and deciding to settle down, but, unlike Krista, I do not want to raise my family, no matter how big or small, in a city. I think that it would not be ideal for me, even if I did have a rooftop garden or other amenities. But, I do praise people like Kirsta who want to and can do that, because anyway to cut down on one’s own carbon footprint will make a positive impact on our climate.

As I mentioned above, I believe that urban living needs to switch to more substantiable food, energy and transportation options. You would expect that many city dwellers would walk everywhere since everything is conglomerated but that is rarely the case. Our transportation system for goods and services is extremely carbon ineffective. While, Ken discusses mass transportation in Manhattan, I believe that Manhattan is one of few cities in the US that has a decent mass transportation system. With that in mind, I believe it is essential for US cities that are considering infrastructure change to consider all transportation systems and styles. We need to analyze and decide which city is most efficient with its energy and improve further on its design. Cities around the world need to implement changes to their food and energy consumption to reduce carbon emissions and we must make the energy efficient cities the first time.

I quite agree with you on the new energy city. Through what we have learned before, I find that many ways to cause carbon emissions are completely impossible to avoid. For example, international students are bound to fly abroad to go to university, clothing companies are bound to produce clothes to earn profits, and people are bound to take public transport to work. All of these are inevitable experiences in our daily life. Therefore, for the current situation, the best choice is to change the traffic mode. After all, the bad impact of traffic on the environment is obvious to all. If it can be adjusted effectively, it will bring great benefits to environmental protection.

It is very concerning how  much carbon must go in to necessities in our life. It feels as if humans ourselves are incapable of living in harmony with the earth. A sad but important reminder is that we are currently way over our carbon limit, and are attempting to lower it not to truly make nature prosper, but rather simply enough that we won't be able to feel the effects our actions have on our planet as opposed to setting goals to actually benefit the environment and make that our first priority, over ourselves. To focus on housing, it does seem tricky to list solutions, as I feel we should go past the idea of just reducing house size, because some people simply won't change, and others who are in poverty in our country would leap at the opportunity to live in a micro house in a "good" or convenient area. I wonder if it would be possible to build more modular homes much like the phonebloks idea were different parts could be replaced easily, or create more resilient homes resistant to mold, termites, or physical damage. I did find the idea of bringing nature to cities to be very interesting, I feel that blending urban with nature would have many benefits, such as increased happiness for those living there, and of course the environmental benefit.

This video Ken mainly describes the impact of housing problems on the environment. The larger the building area, the more carbon emissions the house will have, and the more serious the environmental pollution will be. In the United States, because of the low population density, many people will build large houses to live in, which will cause great pollution to the environment. However, there may be only two generations of people living in a large house. One Comfortable small apartment for the whole family but opted for the big house. I think this housing problem cannot be changed temporarily, but as the population grows, more and more people will choose apartments. However, I hope that citizens can have a sense of environmental protection. They do not choose apartments because of the housing problem caused by the population, but they choose to live in small apartments because of the protection of the environment.

Growing up I feel as though I was always taught that bigger is better. This saying is one that has stuck with my entire life and to be completely honest is probably the reason I am attending UCSB at this moment. I was told that getting into college will help me get a good paying job and will lead me to a life of materials and happiness. Unfortunately, I understood the idea of life to be one that is valued based upon materials or money for a long time. You could have asked me two years ago what is the purpose of school, or college and I would have said to eventually accumulate enough money to live a luxurious life. It is sad but it is true, as America continues to hold this kind of standard I do not believe the necessary changes that must be made to save our planet will happen. As luxuries continue to develop and become more appealing the amount of carbon emissions that an individual releases will only continue to grow. Items such as cars and homes are some of the worst things that add to your carbon footprint, but it seems like people are just continuing to strive for bigger and better. One might say these two are necessities as it will get you to and from important places like work and grocery stores. This week's lecture by Ken shows the solution to problems like these. Ken brings up the idea of microapartments in cities that not only take up little space, but can also allow those to find jobs in the cities to not need an automobile. This lifestyle is one that more people should get behind as it is logical and reduces carbon emissions by a pretty significant amount. Personally, I like the idea of an apartment more than co-housing but they both are solid options to consider when it comes that time in life to choose your place to live. As a country the development of living the American Dream has only got more prominent in many people's life and it is just making the carbon emissions rise more into the atmosphere than ever before. It has been clear through documentaries I have watched and personal experience that bigger is not always better and money will not bring you true happiness if that is your only concern. I do not want to say it will be easy for those who already have luxurious lives to easily make a switch to living a smaller life, but for those who have not yet reached a decision I believe it should be one that is strongly considered. Not only will it make you be more conscious about space, but it will also help reduce your carbon footprint dramatically.

From previous lectures we have discussed materialism, fast fashion, diet, and living conditions; however, when diving more into the topic of modern homes, I was surprised to find out that homes account for 80 metric tons of greenhouse gases emitted when a home is constructed. The proposed solution is to move to cities, where living conditions are more efficient and optimal to minimize greenhouse gases. A city that has been mentioned frequently in New York, my only issue with that is that although New York can be the ideal living place, the cost surpasses the budget for many people. The cost of living can also be seen in cities like San Francisco. In my opinion, if the cost of living in cities were to lower, I think more people would consider moving to or staying in cities rather than moving to suburban areas where the cost of buying a home may be more ideal considering the price of rent in cities. 
        <br><br>
Nevertheless, the environmental movement occurring in cities explained by Ken as integrating nature into city life is, in my opinion, a great idea. Most of the time, city life can be very hectic and loud therefore people move to the outskirts of cities in order to reconnect with nature. Therefore, this distinction between nature and city is drawn. However, by addressing the issue and implementing change by building rooftop gardens, planting more trees and overall bringing more greenery to cities, the culture of cities would become more suitable for all. The simple act of moving to a city is on its own an act of environmental activism is outstanding and progressive.

As someone who grew up in a big city, I couldn't imagine ever living in the suburbs or on the countryside. Before I even knew about the environmental benefits, I always felt like the pros of living in a city outweighed the cons. I really enjoy being able to take public transport anywhere I like, having so many options of where to eat, where to hang out, etc. Me and my friends often just take a walk through the city center or up and down a shopping street. Maybe it's just me, but I love being surrounded by people and being in an area where something is always happening. I think I would get way too bored if I lived in the suburbs. 
        <br><br>
Now that I know of the advantages for the climate, I am even more convinced to live in a city for the rest of my life. Even having an apartment instead of a house sounds a lot more appealing to me. I really like the community feeling of living in an apartment complex. Plus, apartments use the space they have way more efficiently than houses ever could. Living in a McMansion would just stress me out. You have all these rooms to fill, so you'll probably end up buying unnecessary stuff to make it look less empty, which also defeats the whole purpose of being as minimalistic as possible. Additionally, if you live in the suburbs, you have to drive everywhere which dramatically increases your carbon footprint, while in the city, you can just use public transport or bike or - even better - walk. 
        <br><br>
I do get people's argument of wanting to be near nature, but I think it just depends on what city you move to. There are a lot of cities with parks and trees everywhere, maybe even an ocean or a river. Yes, you won't be in the middle of a forest, but let's be honest, how many people actually live in the woods? When somebody talks about wanting to own a house, they don't mean a house in the middle of nowhere. They want to live in the suburbs and those areas often don't provide the kind of nature that you really want either. So I think the whole "nature" argument is often just an excuse for people to keep their unnecessary large houses with their unnecessary big backyards.

I find it very interesting about your beliefs on city living. I have never lived in the city and have grown up in a rural community all of my life so I never know exactly how different my life would be if I grew up in the city. However, because I did not grow up in the city I don’t love it exactly as much as you do and I’m actually a bit more hesitant to move to a city in the long run. I completely agree with Ken that living in an apartment or co-housing communities is a better way of living for the environment, but I just can never get myself to immerse myself into the culture of city living. That does not mean that I want to live in a mansion on the top of a mountain, I still want a small and environmentally friendly home. From my perspective, living in a city creates activities that only encourage someone to spend their money and get stuff. I noticed this when I would go down to LA to visit my boyfriend and when we were thinking of things to do, the only activities that we could do in the city was to either shop for useless items at a mall, or go spend on our money for activities. When I would spend time there, I would find myself falling into that cycle that so many other people do as well, which is by just wanting more stuff and wanting to go out and buy random stuff just because the option is there. 
        <br><br>

Just to add on, I know plenty of people that live in the “woods”, in fact I’ve lived in the “woods” and “in the middle of a forest” for my entire life (because I’m from Yosemite) and it’s not the same as living in a city with a couple of man made parks. The “nature” argument is not always just an excuse and there are some people out there that truly care about being connected with nature and not living a life in the city.

I was surprised to find that 32% of Americans’ carbon allotment comes from their homes. Ken gives us great alternatives to curb this by suggesting a number of different housing options. I understand that many have lived in a house for the majority of their life and it seems like you use all of it, but you have to ask yourself if that much space is really necessary. I grew up and still live in an apartment in Berkeley, California, which is a decent-sized city. Never in all of these years did I wish to have more space. Having more space seems like an excuse to have more stuff. I believe living in an apartment, tiny house, or co-housing in a city is going to be so much better for anyone that chooses it over living in the suburbs. 
        <br><br>

One thing that I can do while living in the city is walk everywhere. I rarely have to use a car to get anywhere in the city because everything is very close and accessible. If it’s too far to walk, there are many public transportation options such as the bus or BART.
        <br><br>

 Another perk of living in a city could be that you reduce the amount of stuff that you own, but don’t need it. When you’re allotted a certain amount of space, you will only fill up your living space with necessities and not a whole lot of junk. Once you live in an apartment, you will realize that you don’t need 2500 sq.ft. to have everything you need under one roof. 
        <br><br>

I understand that some may have some convictions on city living and I concede that it may not be the best option if you would like to own your own property or raise a family there, but once again the benefits far outway the costs so I believe that everyone should try to give city living a chance.

As someone who grew up in suburban Los Angeles, I felt a little guilty when watching this video. Our house is relatively big, we have a pool even though we live near two community pools, and we definitely don’t live sustainably. This is not to say we don’t try to be environmentally friendly, but like most of America, comfort has trumped sustainability. This video has made me realize how important it is to be aware of what our carbon footprint is doing to the environment. I was shocked to find out that the average house today is two times larger than the average house was in the 50’s. Along with this, I was taken aback when I learned that 1/3 of our carbon footprint is used for housing. Housing is a relatively easy fix, since we can downgrade or use less without much trouble. I think lessening our housing carbon footprint is not difficult and it could be implemented across America. 
        <br><br>
I found Ken’s suggestions to be interesting and really applicable. I think community living and micro houses are both interesting ideas. I think people across America could get on board with these ideas, especially for those who live in cities. Co-living could be a cheaper option for people, while helping the environment. I think both of these ideas would be really appealing to millennials, who are trying to afford a place to live with a smaller budget. Obviously, the first step is changing the culture we live in. As college students, we must be living sustainably, voting for environmentally friendly candidates, and teaching others about the climate crisis. We must teach our family members and one day our kids, how to live with a smaller carbon footprint. Changing the attitudes and minds of others allows us to make big improvements, such as co-living, green cities, and micro houses.

While watching this video, I was interested to hear about the different ways we can combat the way that housing takes up space. It was shocking to hear how much square footage a house takes up on average, and it is only rising! It is understandable as to why some may dislike the idea of co-housing as people value their personal space, but having a 2500 sq ft house for 1 person seems excessive. Apartments should be the go to as they provide more than the basic necessities while simultaneously accommodating for more space, thus, proving beneficial to the environment. This problem is in large part due to the capitalist economy, as many other problems are. This economy pushes people to accrue more wealth in order to stay afloat, and because of this more people are seeking to own rather than rent. There is this idea that living in a huge house with acres would lead to content, but this is not entirely true. Though one can gain satisfaction by having a spacious living environment, this is by no means a recipe for happiness. There is also the factor of family size, which is steadily increasing. Nonetheless, smaller living spaces not only would help the environment but could allow for a better society as there will be more space for community establishments, increased overall housing for others which could get people off the streets, and a more connected community if co-housing becomes more prominent. Being from Los Angeles, i have no issue with living in the city as i have for the majority of my life, but this can definitely be too much for those who prefer a lowkey lifestyle. Since most people commute big cities like Los Angeles for work or leisure purposes, living in the city seems like a great idea. The only drawback that comes to mind would be the population. In Los Angeles county, I believe there are ~4 million people most of which reside in the metropolitan area. I'm not sure how this would be dealt with especially as there are already so many homeless people, cars on the road, etc. People are constantly moving to the city, and this is making things worse in this regard.

I agree with you there's this sense that in order to be content in life, you need a big house.  Not only that, but all the other things that Ken mentions as well, from clothes, to stuff, to newer and bigger cars.  This is all part of the "American Dream" and this ideal that we have cooked up, but is it really ideal? I personally didn't even think about the increase in family sizes, and how that impacts the sizing of houses, but it's true, as our population increases, as would average house size.  I agree, we have such a big homeless population, even here in Santa Barbara, but especially where I come from at home in San Diego.  Cohousing could definitely help with this also. 

        <br><br>

However, something I wanted to bring up that Ken didn't seem to address was the fact that we don't really need MORE apartments.  In order to all (or mostly) live in apartments/cities, that would mean an increase in construction of living spaces, which would in turn release greenhouse gasses, and continue the issues we are seeing now.  What we really need, is for people to be responsible and only take a house that truly fits their needs.  We need to stop building new housing, and take advantage of the housing that already exists.  For everyone to move into these "micro apartments," that would mean that new ones would need to be built, and the destruction of the old suburban houses would likely need to occur, which also emits greenhouse gasses.

I agree with your comment. I feel that is absolutely astonishing how big houses are today especially when families are smaller. I also agree that apartments should be the go to as well. I am going to live in an apartment for next year's housing and am very excited mainly because it is bigger than the dorm I live in at the moment because a kitchen is included and I don't have to haul all of my pans and food across the lawn to the nearest kitchen. I actually like the sizes of apartments because I feel that there is not enough room for clutter to build up, which is something that bothers me a lot. This builds to the notion of being happier with having less stuff. I prefer to have less things because then there is not the constant need to feel that you have to attend to them. I agree that this want for more and more things has mainly to do with our capitalist economy as well because there is this notion that the more you have the happier you will be and this could not be further from the truth. I also would like to add that apartments could also help you interact more with the people who live near you. I know that when I stay at home, I rarely ever interact with my neighbors. Most of the time we all just say hi and then rush into the house. Living in a dorm or an apartment is a different story because you are actually living with people in whom you may not know or met. Living in co-housing can prove to build relationships and this will make you a happier person.

I like the points you have made in this comment, as housing is becoming an issue environmentally and its a cultural issue that we need to solve; especially in the United States. I remember the Engl 22 class from last quarter with Ken, he mentioned numerous times, about the MTV Cribs series showcasing the expensive and large houses that celebrities own; through this show I feel like the viewers associated owning a big house with a indoor basketball court as reaching a level of success. Now and days, we want it all, from the luxurious house to the most expensive car because our society made us think that is what we need in order to "proof" we've become successful. 
        <br><br>
Contrary to what society says, I feel like the new movement should be tiny homes. With tiny homes you can really live a minimalistic lifestyle. Plus, with a huge mansion, I feel like it makes families distant whereas with tiny houses there's a small area of living where you can really connect. Therefore, I feel like tiny houses is a huge solution to solving the climate crisis.


<br><hr>
I completely agree on the points about our housing taking up too much space. The concept of American success begins with the house. This house is ideally large, owned instead of rented, and occupied by many children with plenty of room to spare. It's an ideal based in abundance for abundance's sake, or perhaps the view that abundance necessarily leads to happiness (which is certainly not true). I myself have some trouble grappling with this since my family lives far from the city and as such owns a McMansion size house. There is so much unused and underutilized space in that house. On the other hand, my house in IV is perhaps a quarter of that size with double the people, but I don't feel at all cramped in there. I was shocked how little space a person truly needs.
        <br><br>


While new construction of homes would mean some greenhouse gas emissions, I believe in the long run it's more beneficial. Coming from the Bay Area, I quickly realized the reason so much housing development is happening there is because of the absurd house prices that leave many homeless or living in their cars. If housing was built smaller and more efficiently, then in the long run, people's climate footprints would substantially decrease. If a McMansion is torn down in the process, causing some emissions, I still believe this would be better than having to cool that giant house down in the summer with extremely environmentally costly refrigerants (among other things that increase with scale of the house).

<br><hr>

I agree with you. I think it is very excessive for 1 person to live in a 2500 sq ft house, when you can live in an apartment. Everyone living by themselves should live in an apartment because it has everything necessary for 1 person and it reduces the person's carbon footprint. Ken mentions that one way to reduce carbon footprint is to move to cities. I am 50/50 on this. I disagree because as Ikenna says this could make everything much more crowded and could increase the homeless population in many cities, which is already terrible right now. I agree with it because being from NYC many people do not drive anywhere. Almost all my friends and family use public transportation or walk to go places. This is because there is so much traffic they do not want to deal with it. This dramatically reduces their carbon footprint. So if everyone moved to cities most people will probably feel this way which will force them to walk, take public transportation, and live in apartments which reduces carbon footprint.

<br><hr>
I was also shocked to hear how much negative impact housing has on the environment! It definitely is excessive that 1 person have 2500 sqft of housing. I understand that the rich will always have this, but for the average person to have this much is putting a hurt on the environment. You mention being from Los Angeles and how most people commute. People are actually moving into the city which is causing a problem. Maybe if the people who were coming into the cities came with the ideology of a green metropolis. Imagine how different dirty L.A. would be and the impact it would have. I hope this is the case.What if all the homeless people in LA became environmentalist, and did guerrilla gardening and other practices that would better the environment. That would be amazing.

<br><hr>
You make a series of fantastic points about compact housing Ikkena. It is absolutely unnecessary to have 2500+ square foot house for one person. On the other hand, I can see why people have tended to gravitate to these styles of living. Media and entertainment have reinforced the notion that big houses are associated with wealth. While I can respect that this is the way most people have been taught, we must break through the confines of traditional social norms and make educated decisions regarding our houses in relation to our carbon footprint. Instead, people should begin to explore alternative options such as apartments and tiny living communities, which as you said not only reduces one’s carbon footprint but also frees up spaces for the rest of society as our population inevitably grows beyond sustainability. This could include moving to the city as well because of the abundance of small living spaces. People might feel as though this is not worth it though because of the high cost of living in certain cities for simple apartments, such as IV or LA as you mentioned. All we can do at this point is call attention to the housing crises and hope the world can transition to affordable, smaller living spaces.
<br><hr>
It is clear to see the growth of house sizes nowadays. One event about supersized houses that surprised me is a celebrity’s house tour, it was like a castle, I wonder how well he can use every space. Due to large population, apartments are the most common ones people live in my home country, when I first came here I realized that there are more houses than apartments. Houses take up more space than apartments, and as Ken mentions in the video the average amount of footage a house takes up is shocking. I used to dream of living in a big house, but as I grow, I’ve realized that I don’t need that much space to live.

All of the points in this lecture are so relevant to climate-oriented living. As a kid, I always dreamed of living in a big house. My little sister and I used to play games where we'd imagine our house was mansion, and we were living lavishly. I have to say, this fantasy stayed with me for quite some time. For a long time I've imagined myself living in a bigger house when I got older. However, after living in the dorms for almost a year now, I've realized I don't need as much space as I've always thought I did. And, I've actually really enjoyed it. I have way less "stuff" than I had before I moved here, and it's so freeing. I really like living with my roommate, and sharing a little space. I use way less trash, drive less, and consume less "stuff." I'm continuing this way of living next year as well. I'll be living with 7 people, and we've all talked about limiting how much stuff we have in the house. I''m really excited to see how we all work together to conserve energy and resources in the house. (ie 7 people 2 showers) 
        <br><br>

I think that this is definitely a way of life more people should be looking into. Obviously, there is a degree to which this can be difficult for some people.  People with disabilities, families, etc. will struggle with aiming for a minimalistic lifestyle. However, if you are able to, I believe it can be so beneficial not only for the environment, but for you as well. I think this way of living can play a major role in moving towards degrowth as we talked about it last class. It blew my mind that 1/5 of new houses in the US are over. 3,000 sq feet.For large families, perhaps that's. understandable, but for singles, couples, or families with 1-2 children that is a large amount of space. I liked how Ken connected this to Japanese homes, and how they are 1/10 this size. We definitely need to be looking at our way of "average" living from a much bigger perspective.

In regards to co-housing and moving back to the city I don't think it's a horrible idea but in some cases living in the city is extremely expensive. My sister went to San Francisco State University and lived in Daly City, next to San Francisco. There she was paying $900 a month for a room. She had friends that lived in the city that were paying over $2000 for the same size room. She said they had to sell their cars in order to afford living because of the burden of paying for parking, the cost for gas, and any possible parking or traffic violations. But considering what Ken said, this may be a good movement after all. My sister said 9 of her 12 friends sold their cars when they moved into the city. Just that simple choice saved the earth from so much carbon. When I was younger I really didn't understand why they did this but now that I'm older I can see how expensive it really is. If more people did the same it would cut so many people's carbon footprints because 1 they're living is smaller homes and possibly/ most likely sharing it and 2 getting rid of a car is an obvious reason your carbon footprint would decrease. Housing and cars are huge contributors to everyone's carbon footprint. These two moves would be greatly beneficial to the world as a whole if a lot of people can get on board.

I grew up in both a big city and the suburbs, as my mom lives in San Francisco and my dad lives in the suburban town across the Golden Gate bridge. I loved growing up in the suburbs but always found it so annoying how far away everything was. In San Francisco, I could walk, take Bart, take the bus, or bike whenever I wanted. But in the suburbs, I would have to drive sometimes as far as 30 minutes away just to get to my friend's house. And all of my friends would take separate cars to school and home, and often when we would hang out we would drive separately to meet instead of picking each other up. In addition to this, I always found it strange how some of them would have huge houses with three people living inside. Some of my friends complained that they never saw the family because their house was so big and spaced out. This baffled me. What is the point of having a house that big if you don’t even enjoy it? I honestly noticed that my friends with bigger houses weren’t as close to their families as my friends with smaller houses. I'm not sure if this is a coincidence or not, but logically it makes some sense. It is obviously pretty hard to raise a family in a tiny apartment, but it's also not necessary to buy a four-story mansion to house three people. I think it is important for us to find some sort of middle ground. We can’t expect everyone to sell their suburban mansions and move to an apartment in a big city, but it is possible for us to stop building homes that are so big, and to encourage people to stop buying them. A possible way to do this is to make houses that are over a certain amount of square feet much more expensive by taxing them higher. This is just one idea, and there are many more things that can be implemented to stop these houses from becoming more popular. I went from living in a normal-sized home to a tiny dorm, as did most other people who go to college, and none of us seem to have that many issues with it. The amount of space required for a living is not very much. My dorm room is smaller than my bedroom at home, and there are three people living in it, and it's perfectly fine. I think if the whole association with big houses and success/status was gone, not as many people would feel the need to buy them.

I loved that Ken discussed both co-housing and urban farming. I have always been fascinated by these ideas and I think they’re exciting solutions to our ever-growing climate crisis. Having lived in Isla Vista for almost two years now I can confidently say that having housemates is a much more rewarding experience than living alone. You develop close friendships that never would have happened if you didn’t live together. You also gain valuable skills such as patience and conscientiousness. I think co-housing is great, both for the environment and your personal development. Urban farming is intriguing because it can greatly impact our food consumption. If we produce even just a small amount of the food we consume, we will be decreasing our food related emissions. The food we grow instead of buy will not have the carbon emissions related to the transportation and production of that food tied to it. The new prevalence of climate activists who are trying to blend the line between urban and rural life is interesting. I think city dwellers who focus more of their energy on composting and gardening will have a positive impact on the climate change movement.

Also having lived with roommates for the past two years, I agree with the many benefits you’ve listed in regards to co-housing. Personal benefits like saving on groceries, creating close relationships, and having accessible entertainment at any given moment are greatly appealing, however, there may be more to consider in this issue. The environmental benefits are great as well for saving resources and space, but not everyone has the opportunity to live with others. Certain budgetary, spacial, or preferential issues may restrict people from being able to do this, unfortunately. I also very much agree with the many benefits of urban farming as  this could greatly decrease food related emissions, but again, this isn’t always a possibility. Growing up in a place with access to land and resources to grow some of my own food, I was able to plant a pretty extensive garden that benefitted my family greatly. However, this idea somewhat contradicts with Ken’s views on tight city-living. He suggests living small in large cities for many reasons like walking/biking to work, saving housing space and emissions, etc.  However, living in a cramped apartment in New York City for example may not exactly provide residents with the necessary space for growing their own food. Many people do live in places like this and are helping the environment in this way, but are unable to grow their own food which contributes to food production related emissions, so this situation becomes kind of a win-lose in respect to the climate change bettering effort.

While this is my first year having roommates and I agree the experience of co-housing is something that you don't get that often.  I have shared a room before but before I left for college I was in my own room and space. What I once dreaded I now embrace and now it doesn't feel as at home when I sleep alone.  It also makes me feel even better knowing the community I live in is more conscious about our environment. When I see celebrity mansions or families who live in a big house I always question what they are doing with all that extra space and why do they feel the need to have it. It seems so unnecessary to me especially now when I can fit my whole life into a much smaller space that is shared with two other people. Ken suggests living in cities to reduce emissions but I feel both cities and rural areas have their pros and cons. While cities have easily accessible transportation, they tend to be overcrowded, dangerous, and unsanitary, which can all be very dangerous to the public. Rural areas are able to grow their own produce and live will solar panels which is a huge improvement to our environment. I feel like the bottom line in seeing change is making some sort of effort no matter what your situation to help change the environment for the better.
<br><hr>
I also loved how Ken brought up co-housing in particular. While I was mostly unaware of the concept beforehand, after looking into it and seeing how they’re mini communities, I can see how beneficial towards the environment they can be. Aurora brought up a good point in how members of this community also personally develop as social beings. Living alone has its drawbacks, and I feel like putting yourself in the situation of co-housing can provide many lessons for one to grow from. I’ve personally brought myself out of my own shell by “couch-surfing” IV this school year. By this I mean even though I currently live in an apartment, I usually end up crashing at a friend’s place. I’ve probably formed more friendships in the past few months than I did in my entire 1st year stuck in the dorms. Tying it back into the climate crisis, it boils down into utilizing forms of activism in which not only can a person contribute to fighting for a good cause, but also benefit themselves.

Before watching this video I never realized how one could significantly reduce their carbon emissions by moving to a bigger city. In my hometown everyone drives everywhere, because everything is really spread out and there are no safe bike lanes to get from place to place. Before moving here I had no idea how to use the bus system because no one really used public transportation. We would have to go out of town for a lot of things, such as the mall, because there were only a limited places to go and things to do. If we were to all move into bigger cities we wouldn't have to leave town because all of the places that we would want to go would be in our proximity. In bigger cities there are safe bike lanes that can be used instead of their car, and the bus system is more reliable since so many are dependent on it. Moving to a bigger city can significantly reduce carbon emissions in a variety of ways. Not only does moving to a bigger city reduce carbon emissions because of the way we get from place to place, but we would be forced into living in smaller places. In my town most families have large houses out in the country, however that is not possible in large cities due to the lack of space. Large houses cause a large amount of carbon emissions to be released through heating and cooling. If we were to live in larger cities we would use cars less, and live in smaller spaces, and reduce our carbon emissions.

I had a very similar upbringing to you, I grew up in a town that heavily relied on private transportation to get everywhere due to poor biking and busing systems. As much as I enjoy driving around town, I always envied people who lived in cities because having your local grocery store or food a walk away sounds much more social and convenient than driving 10 minutes each way. The social aspect of cities is what intrigues me, driving everywhere is a very isolating activity and it keeps you confined from everyone else in the area. You get in your car, park, get your things, and get back in your car to head home. No physical elements are present in the activity like it would be in the city. I think most people would love to live in areas similar to European cities and New York’s infrastructure but it’s not very obtainable in the US because our cities are mainly formatted to please car transportation. I’ve been enjoying my time here in Isla Vista, riding my bike to get coffee and going to classes because It makes me feel more social and active than when I drove in my hometown. Dorm life reminds me of what city communal living would be like and so far I really enjoy the lifestyle. The environmental benefits of communal living makes it all the better. Living in small spaces takes up less space and requires smaller amounts of heating and cooling that releases heavy amounts of Co2 into our atmosphere.


<br><hr>
My hometown is also suburban and relies heavily on personal cars to get around. Not only is private transportation very necessary, my home is also unnecessarily large now that my brother and I do not use the house. The house has multiple unused rooms since my 2 parents are the only people living there, despite it having enough room for multiple families. Not only is the house huge, it is also considerably farther from stores and other urban centers than the home I previously lived in less than a year ago. To get to the nearest target, I would need to drive around 15 minutes, not including the way back. This all adds up to a disproportionate and unnecessarily high carbon footprint. 
        <br><br>
After my brother moved out a couple years, ago, I've found that his footprint is a fraction of our parent's. He lives in a small San Francisco apartment with his girlfriend. His apartment is just 1.5 times as big as my FT dorm, yet it has all the necessities and he is happy with his living conditions. Compared to my parents who live in a space probably 100 times as large, the smaller living space is not only more efficient, it is more convenient since he doesn't even need a car to get around. To get to work or other places, he uses an electric scooter. As for my lifestyle in Santa Barbara, I don't need my car to get to class or to get food, and my dorm is a fraction of the size of my old home. While I don't blame my parents for wanting a more lavish lifestyle since they are immigrants, I strongly believe that I can convince them to adopt a more environmentally suitable lifestyle.

<br><hr>
I agree with the points you made in your comment. I can relate to your experience with public transportation as I come from a small town where traffic is not bad so people drive everywhere, even though everything is really close to each other. Biking is not very common although we do have bike lanes. People who would bike to school in high school were often made fun of instead of applauded for helping reduce their carbon footprint. I agree with you that moving to a bigger city often times results in reducing our carbon footprint since rent for large places are more expensive. This then leads to people living a minimalistic lifestyle by living in small houses and often times using public transportation because of traffic . Ken mentioned that in Japan the average house size is way smaller compared to traditional American houses. This reminded me of a video I watched about Japans Sleeping Pods hotels. I found it very interesting how people who were traveling from America preferred to rent out one of these sleeping pod hotels but when they go back home they not encouraged or motivated to make these changes.

I've always wanted to have a cute little home in a cool location. To me, as long as it's somewhere I enjoy and has enough space to be comfortable I would be totally fine. I really love the idea of having an apartment while living in a green city. Cities have always seemed intimidating for me to live in because my hometown is basically in the middle of nowhere and surrounded by hills and nature. I think green cities would encourage a lot of people that would have never considered city living to move. Green cities are a great mix of cultures and can help people feel more at home. I love the idea of having a tiny house as well. I think it would be really cool to customize a space that works just for you. I've always been the type of person to take a lot of pride in my personal spaces, I love decorating and keeping my stuff organized. Anyone who feels the same would probably love the idea of a tiny home too. What is also great about tiny homes is that they can be mobile as well. If you need to move for something like a job then your beloved space can be taken with you. Tiny homes are overall very appealing for me because of their utility and customization and I hope they become a lot more common.

I agree, growing up I have never been one to hold onto things and I always want everything simple and organized. I feel like a small house requires you to do this and would be really nice to live in. I always find myself saying I don’t care how big my house is as long as it is next to the beach. Now that I have learned how much more sustainable a smaller house is I am more likely to want to live in a smaller house. I agree that the idea of living in a city would be really cool too. I love being able to explore different museums and restaurants which cities fill. I also love the idea of being able to walk to all of your daily necessities which cities allow. I think the idea of tiny homes being mobile is really cool as well. Especially if you live somewhere like california where you want to spend most of your day outside. I think sometimes when people live in huge houses they waste their time inside. When in a tiny home they would want to sit outside a lot more. Another thing with tiny homes which are beneficial is the time you save. Growing up we would always have to spend so much time cleaning the house. But in a tiny house there is less stuff to get misplaced and a way smaller area to clean which would be beneficial.

I haven't always envisioned myself living in a small home. In high school one of my assignments was to make a vision board, and I remember one of the things I put in mine involved wanting to have a huge kitchen. Honestly I'm not sure why I wanted a huge kitchen if I don't even cook much. Maybe I just wanted it because of all the Food Network shows I saw as a child. Anyways, after taking this class and English 22, I am now leaning towards wanting to live in a small house as well. I actually decided to reply to your comment because when I read the first line of your comment, I instantly thought of the little house surrounded by flowers the teacher in Matilda was living in before the end of the movie, and that made me happy. I think green cities are a cool idea as well. It is cool to see how cities can provide easier and better public transportation. I also like the point you made about cities being a good mix of cultures.

<br><hr>
I don’t know about other people but I’ve always wanted to live in an urban setting, not suburban and definitely not rural. Seeing other comments made by our peers, it makes me feel sort of left out (? but not really) because of the unknown that of living in a new environment. Until I read the first line of your comment. Of course, I interpreted it differently than you might’ve intended where my “cool location” is the urban city and my “cute little home” is a decently sized apartment with a view. It’s been a dream of mine to live somewhere like Manhattan or Los Angeles because like Ken mentioned, it can be more convenient due to less car use and smaller housing. At first, I didn’t understand why Ken was promoting living in the city; Los Angeles (where I am from) has a lot of pollution which can be very evident from the top of a skyscraper in Downtown and from the Hollywood sign in Hollywood. But learning about cities and people who are trying to incorporate nature within their lives encourages me to broaden my horizons on where to live while reducing my carbon emission. Regardless, I want to live in a smaller space because I agree that the convenience of taking my space with me is very appealing and seeing how by 2050 55% of people living in the cities will increase to at least two-thirds, hopefully, the small home trend will prosper and be incorporated in our culture.

This past summer, I visited my relatives in Vietnam for the first time in 10 years. Since I was so young back then, I never stopped and looked at the way they lived. Their homes were significantly smaller than American homes, yet they were able to fit extended family members such as my aunts, uncles, and their children into one home. Interestingly enough, I learned in my psychology classes that there are stark differences between individualistic (Western) cultures compared to collectivistic (Eastern) cultures. Since Vietnam is a relatively poorer country compared to a lot of other Asian countries, this housing lifestyle is typical, yet very helpful to reducing one’s annual average carbon footprint. My hometown, Orange County, California, is mainly a suburban area, therefore every family has their own home. My father always emphasized how different his life in America was compared to Vietnam, and told me that I was lucky to have this life. Yet, I think I (along with lots of other Americans) take it all for granted. We contribute more to our carbon footprints with this lifestyle, whereas living in larger cities such as NYC or even Saigon (Vietnam) would reduce our footprints immensely. Now that I live in an apartment with my friends, I can definitely see the benefits of co-housing, and I plan to continue to do so for the next two years of college.

I am completely with you! The last time I visited my family back in Vietnam was also 10 years ago (2010!) The differences between the living spaces here and Vietnam are stark. Especially here in the US, we live large. Our houses, cars, and even food are way bigger here than in other countries. Funny enough, my grandfather said the same thing that your dad said. We have it very good here and we should be very lucky to be in the situation that we are in. But on the flip side, we should also be conscientious of the fact that we are consuming and wasting so much. We want to be able to tell our own kids how lucky they are, and that'll only be possible if we live more sustainable lifestyles.

<br><hr>
Your comments sound really interesting to me, but I think for people in Asia that the situation is much different from the United States. I still remember during the lecture that Ken mentioned the average square feet of Japan and the United States. Japan has much smaller apartments or houses, but did he aware of that the price in Japan is extremely high and Japan has much and much smaller land when compared to the US. It is unfair to compare Japan and the US, not to mention a highly condensed population that Japan has. It is unable or impossible to build houses like this in most Asian countries. 

        <br><br>

Due to the typical Asain lifestyle, somehow, helped to reduce the carbon footprint. But those countries need to develop. The release of carbon emission still hard to prevent. The apartments are getting larger and larger nowadays, it is about the size of a house or even bigger. So maybe moving to the cities and apartments in the future might not as environmentally friendly as it was.

It is really amazing to see how differently people live in other parts of the world relative to our Western society, and it must have been impactful for you to see the contrast in person. I have relatives in Greece, and from listening to my parent’s stories about how their parents/friends lived when they were there is eye opening. They too lived in much smaller, more modest homes, and lived incredibly simply. They place so much more value on family, friends, and making good food! There are so many lessons we can learn from them by just observing the way they live. We tend to think downsizing and living simply would be incredibly difficult, but billions of people do it every single day. And you’re right in that we take a lot for granted when we try and fill our lives with so much stuff. I think that sharing housing with friends is a great experience. It allows you to form bonds with people, experience new things together, and together we can collectively save so much money buying food and supplies together. I would love to continue to live with friends for a while, even when out of college. Our society needs to shift its thinking from wanting larger and more ornate homes, to wanting ones that are small, efficient, and suit our needs perfectly. Our planet cannot afford to have everyone live a luxurious life, and people shouldn’t want to. Life is about so much more than what we own and where we live, and I think our relatives understand that.

<br><hr>
 I agree. The most common type of housing in China is apartments. Many Chinese families live in apartments where a building holds about 500 people. This is because the population of China is very big and the price of housing is much more expensive than that in the US. It is still a goal of lots of Chinese people to work hard and own a big house. Given the option, a lot of people in China would probably choose to live in big houses. But there are more and more people in China that are starting to grow plants on the rooftops to be more environmentally friendly.

Your message is interesting in how it analyzes the topic of modern living with a cultural view. As you explained Vietnam has a collectivistic culture where a large family coexists under the same roof, whereas in the United States an individualistic culture is employed where a family consisting of parental figures and children live in a home and the extended family members live somewhere else that might mean a flight away. Therefore, Vietnam compared to the United States is contributing much less natural greenhouse gases because of their cultural practices.
<br><hr>
Thank you for sharing your experience of visiting your relatives in Vietnam. Your comment about how your family members were able to fit extended family members in their homes made me think of how my aunt and cousin used to live with my family and I. When my aunt and cousin came from the Philippines they didn’t have a place to stay so they stayed with us for about 3 years. Our household size went from 4 to 6 people in a pretty small home. Looking back at the time when my aunt and cousin lived with my family and I, it was great. Similarly, your comment reminds me of the other side of my family where there are 9 people living under the same roof in a 3 bedroom home. They do this because they simply cannot afford to move out to anywhere in LA (which is where I’m from). They also choose to stay together because that is the way it is. Supersizing into a McMansion (as you mention very often Ken) isn’t an option for them, and neither is moving into a smaller home.

Watching this video made me think about what I plan to do for my living situation for when I am older. Having lived in a small home and sharing a room with my sibling, I have no problem living in shared spaces. I actually prefer it. All things considered, I plan to continue living in shared spaces, like living with a roommate, for its affordability and sustainability.

I also visited my relatives in Asia this past summer and noticed that even though their homes were significantly smaller, they still seemed to have a decent amount of space for everyone. But, this was also in a city versus in a suburban area. My relatives in Asia that do not live in the city tend to live in slightly larger homes. Moving to a city would likely reduce our living space and thus also our carbon footprint. I also have noticed and it does make sense that the Western and Eastern cultures and different. The collectivistic culture in Eastern cultures makes co-housing and smaller dwellings with more people much more common than in Western cultures. I have also really seen the benefits of co-housing as I am currently living in an apartment with others. While I do understand why co-housing may not be an attractive option to some people, I believe a 2500 square foot house for a single person is definitely way too much and could easily be cut down.  A smaller living space would also mean being forced to spend more time outside instead of staying home all day which is something I did experience living in the dorms and think is a positive thing. So downsizing on homes really has lots of great benefits as you can save money, decrease your carbon footprint, and experience the world outside more.

Being in college has really changed my ideas about co-housing and living in close quarters with other people. Back home I live in a relatively spacey home and I have my own room, which allows me to have personal space and isolation when needed. When I was packing for college, I was dreading the idea of having to move into a smaller room and share it with two people, when at home I had so much space to myself. However, I quickly figured out that living with other people in close quarters is actually quite fun and a better experience than living alone. Also this transition helped me realize that I had been a much larger consumer of goods than needed. I was forced to take only what I really needed instead of everything I possibly could have in the world. At first this seemed unfortunate but I quickly realized how much stuff that I owned that I didn't even need. 
        <br><br>

Because of my experience in college I think that co-housing and moving to the city are two wonderful ideas to help curb climate change. However, I think that many people are afraid to commit to this lifestyle because it seems like it would be terrible. What people need to realize is that so much of the thins we think we really care about are not actually important in life, we just think they are. If more people just gave this new way of living a try I'm sure a lot more people would like it better than they thought they would.

I can relate to what you said regarding how college has really changed your perspective on co-housing and living with other people you may not be familiar with. I think it creates a great environment that really allows you to self reflect on your behaviors. It allows you to realize how some of your actions can really affect others. It can also allow you to create communication skills in order to create a safe living space that you share with others. You brought up a really good point about being able to distinguish between things you needed and things you simply owned. I can actually relate to the realization because thinking about all of the stuff I have back at home, I feel like there’s so much clutter lying around. Moving to college only allowed me to take what I needed, and if there was space, what I wanted. I believe living on a college campus is a really good example as to how communities should be structured. Living on a college campus has reduced my carbon footprint in so many ways. Back at home, I used to drive almost every day to get to places, whereas now, I can bike, walk, or bus to where I need to be. So, I do agree with what you say about how people’s idea of importance aren’t actually important in terms of how others will think of them when they change their lifestyle.

 I feel the same way as both of you. Moving extremely far from my hometown to university, I carried and packed four luggages. In order to fit all my stuff and bring everything I need by flying, I minimize my personal belongings and also discover how much bags and makeups that I have the most in my room are not really important to me. Sometimes we just think we need everything we possess and might need more of it. However, moving from home to college makes me throw away many things that I rarely use; I became a person who is now not afraid of dumping away unnecessary stuff. In addition, since the start of college, I have reduced my carbon footprint just as Ken mentioned. I started to take the bus to school instead of taking Uber or Lyft. I began to eat like a freegan who often eats more veggies than meat. I walk from place to place. These minute actions lead to more efficient and effective life for me.
<br><hr>
I agree that my ideas on co-housing and essentials have all changed since coming to college and I can honestly say I sleep better at night knowing my lifestyle is more climate-friendly. Living in the same room as two other people, I realized that not much could be taken because of the limited space. This really helped me realize what a huge consumer I am, just as you stated. When going through my clothes, I realized that so many items were just so cheap and unnecessary. With everyone in such close quarters, my carbon footprint is also reduced because I can walk on foot to meet people and get places I want to go. Also the idea of sharing utilities and really just using less makes me agree with you and Ken that co-housing and city living are amazing options. 

        <br><br>

For so long in our society and way of life, we have been taught to dominate nature rather than co-exist. This forceful and rude way of living pushed us away from sustainability and towards greed and power. We don't need a lot of space. We don't need the best and the biggest. Living with less not only is better for the environment, but also pushes you to connect with things on a deeper level rather than the superficial aspects of things which is yet another lesson college continues to teach me.

Actually, I don't get the point why many people do not put photovoltaic solar cells on top of their roofs. In the long run, it is going to recover the cost of installing them and people can benefit from it every single day after it. Furthermore, I can understand why people tend to move and live in a bigger house instead of a micro-apartment since a big nice house is a symbol of wealth according to many individuals' perspectives. However, moving into a big house in a suburban area usually means fewer interpersonal contacts among the neighborhood. It is quite a good experience to know more people by living in cohousing communities in a city and, at the same time, reduce one's carbon footprint dramatically.

I think the idea of co-housing and micro apartments doesn’t sound too bad considering I’m currently living at the university dorms, where I share a room with someone else and a whole floor with like 40+ people. For a large portion of my life, I’ve shared a room with someone, that being my sister or all of my family members, depending on our economic standing. I’ve even lived in a two-story house, which I know isn’t small at all, but in total there were about seventeen of us living in four rooms, the life of a Mexican family man. To be fair it does get tiring not having the personal space, but even in a large home people still get tired of one another, so maybe that’s not a good argument as to why one can’t live in micro apartments.

 
        <br><br>

Another good thing about it is that we could all make those dreams of living in a house with all of our best friends come true. On the plus side, it could potentially be cheaper, maybe? I don’t know but seems like a good thing in the long run if it helps with the environmental issue at hand. I also feel like it would ease some pressure on having a whole house to decorate, now it would just be a smaller area to worry about. It would also benefit us not having to buy so many things as one would to fill up the empty spaces in big homes. This ties back to the minimalist documentary from a couple of weeks ago.

I share a similar experience. Co-housing has been apart of my life since I was born. I have shared a room with my family members, more than one, for my whole life. The life of a Mexican family is no joke! And now, it doesn't feel any different living with my friends. This upbringing definitely makes the idea of living in micro-apartments easy, but like you said, not having the personal space did get tiring at times too. Because of this I feel torn. I remember wanting to have my own room, my own big space when I got older and now I am and I am realizing how bad that dream is for the earth. Every day I learn how much better living a minimal life is. I constantly think of the things we are doing for the planet while there are still so many rich, middle-class people who are not going to follow any of this. I know that is an awful way of looking at it, no change will happen. But, those thoughts still constantly come up for me. I agree completely with Ken and I am motivated to seek a micro-apartment for the next couple of years but I do think I will seek a medium-size home when I form a family.

I too wouldn't be opposed to co-housing because when you live in a dorm at college or share an apartment with others, you're technically doing the exact same thing so we as students get a taste of the kind of environment that comes hand in hand with that kind of arrangement. Since we are young we see our version of co-housing as a fun and an engaging experience, but I think that as you get older that idea gets a little less favorable when you start considering things such as privacy and independence. Obviously not everyone thinks this way and can exist in large groups of people such as your living situation in the past, but at least in my personal opinion I wouldn't want to have several roommates to deal with after a long day when I just want to be alone and have some me time to myself.  I remember going to my parents house in India when I was young and being appalled at the idea that my dad's siblings and all of their families lived in the same house as my grandparents in a single unit. Up till that point I was so used to having my own room and only living with my parents + my brother so it was a shock to see so many people using the same facilities and space while genuinely enjoying the arrangement. There definitely is a culture divide regarding the issue of co-housing in the US which plays a factor into why it is not a common lifestyle for many.I think this is the main reason why people wouldn't be  too keen upon taking up co-housing in the future. We have gotten so accustomed to the idea of nuclear families that live in an isolated space that the idea of blending them seems absurd to someone who has never been exposed to that. With more exposure and people joining into this lifestyle, I feel like co-housing could be more widespread, helping not only the environment but bringing families closer to each other for the better.

Micro housing and cities is one of the easiest lifestyle changes in my class for me to get behind, though it is not without its problems. For some background, until I came to UCSB for college, I grew up in what I could call a fairly typical suburb and therefore I needed to be driven just about everywhere I needed to go. My dad became my usual driver, and for a big portion of my life he had to make a brutal 2 hour commute every day. I got to see firsthand how much of a mental weight this became for him, and he would tell me how much he used to like driving back before this commute. This made me never want to ever have to actually drive myself, but this left me with a big problem, as living in suburbia meant that I was pretty immobile without a car, so I just felt really stuck. Moving to UCSB however taught me two things, the first being that is possible to live somewhere where everything you need is within traveling distance (in our case bikes and busses), and the second is that it is actually possible to live near where you work. This influenced my current desire to want to move to a city, as this would mean that I could walk or use public transport to get to work, and also live in a micro apartment. In addition to being near my occupation I like the concept of micro apartments because they both mean I have less room to clean/maintain, but also there is less room for material stuff, which I find to be a burden to have too much of. One of the things that I’d worry about moving to a city would be the lack of nature, which is where the green cities movement gives me a lot of hope, but another problem would be what to do when I decide I want to get a family, which the lecture also proposes a solution to which is co housing. In addition to being good for the environment, I feel that co housing could be great for raising children because of the sort of extended family it would provide.

I agree with microhousing that it has a good place, even smaller rooms, but we can clean them in less time, which is more convenient and less incident. However, for the Chinese people, we are used to thinking that big and more luxurious looking houses are definitely better. Maybe for me, now I prefer small green rooms, and I also love the feeling of sharing kitchen and dinner with my community neighbors. But I think it's better for most Chinese or other people to have independent and bigger looking accommodation. That's why I always think that for me, I can contribute to the protection of the environment, but I don't think that the so-called good methods have obvious effect on the public. So I think we need to give people more experience opportunities and more communication, so that they can more appreciate the benefits brought by micro housing and housing, so that we can more readily accept, otherwise I think many people will not take the initiative to accept such methods.

<br><hr>
I relate to your story. Where I grew up, I was one neighborhood up the hill from both my middle school. However, right before I entered middle school, they canceled the bus line through my neighborhood due to lack of funding. Although we tried to do it occasionally, the walk was just a little too long on slightly dangerous roads (curvy with no sidewalks) to do everyday. This meant that countless families then had to drive to school every day rather than take public transport. This bus system could have also taken me to my high school. Yet, it didn't exist, so for 7 years I was driven or drove myself to and from school every single day. When put in this context, I now see how big of an impact this could make on the environment. Similarly, people in my family commuted even farther. I had an uncle who lived in Marin (Inverness for anyone who may know) and drove to and from San Francisco everyday for their job (1-2 hours each way).
        <br><br>
 Moving to UCSB also had a big impact on me. I'm riding my bike and taking the bus more than ever in my life. I’m living with roommates, and plan on living this way for the entirety of my college career. I will have to remember the way that I live this year even when I have my car with me next year, and not fall victim to convenience. 
        <br><br>
 I also agree with your concerns about cities and micro housing. Although we all want to believe that we will be able to find a place near our job and public transportation, the housing crisis just might not permit this. What will we do when the places in the city center, right by the job and the grocery store, are out of our budget? In reality, I think that to make micro housing and sustainable housing and cities a real potential, we will need a massive reshaping of housing policy. I agree that co-housing and green cities could provide a solution to social and environmental issues, but just like most issues discussed in this class, we might need a total overhaul in policy.
<br><hr>
I'm in the same boat as you, I too live in the suburbs and relied mainly on my parents to drive my family and I around. I'm from Los Angeles and the traffic problem is terrible due to how many people are commuting to and from work. What would normally be a thirty minute drive has turned into a 2 hour commute for my dad to get to work and something needs to change. I started working part time with my dad and I couldn't bare being in the car for that long under the blazing sun waiting for inexperienced drivers to move out the way. I didn't really get out of the house that often because of this and since money was short I did not have a car for myself. However coming to UCSB I also learned that you don't need a car to travel around places and that if everything is within walking distance then there really is no need for one. Also living in an apartment complex/ residence hall is not as bad as people make it seem like because back in my house in LA, I really only went to specific rooms in my house and the other rooms were just there. Having a smaller living area also made me more social because It made me go out and enjoy company with others and it helped me sleep because it was a smaller place. Also I really am an advocate for bringing nature to cities such as having roof gardens because as Dave Foreman stated, "civilization inescapably creates a rift between human beings and nature" and it is hurting our planet because of it. Climate activism is very important and I really think others should think about micro-apartments and co-housing.

<br><hr>
I completely agree that micro housing is one of the movements in this class that I would most easily get behind. I have always liked having my stuff in one place, rather than in a big house, and it forces you to have less stuff in general. Currently, my dad lives in a studio apartment in Venice. If he ever moves out of it, I plan to move in. It is a perfect size for me, and it's in a great location. So my plan for the future already incorporates micro housing. I also understand your feelings of being trapped without a car in a big city. I didn't drive in high school, and still don't have a car now even though I have my license. When I am home in Los Angeles, it is very hard for me to get around without a car, because everything is at least 15 or 20 minutes away. Although Uber is an option, it gets expensive after a while. I might consider moving to a town where I can bike or walk to work, as I love biking as a form of transportation, but it all depends on where work takes me. I like that my plan of living in the Venice studio apartment helps out with my personal carbon footprint.
<br><hr>
I also think that micro housing is probably the easiest thing that I could implement in my life. My house in the Bay Area is actually not very large since the area that I live in is quite expensive, so I am already used to living in a smaller, yet more modern/well-designed, home. I think that it makes a lot of sense that 17% of the average American’s carbon footprint comes from the heating and cooling of our homes and it hope that, with micro housing, it will cost less (carbon footprint wise) to heat up/cool down our homes since, the smaller the home is, the easier it is to control its inside temperature. It kind of scares me to think that 32% of the American carbon footprint comes from our homes and, although there is an embedded cost of carbon within our houses, this cost is still lesser than that of the embedded cost of carbon within our automobile industry/usage.

When I was in high school, I was always very busy with playing the piano, taking guitar classes, going to science fairs, and managing my school work on top of everything. But my parents, specifically my mom, had to drive my brother and I everywhere that we went and it was extremely taxing for them. I never really had the intense desire to drive and own a car. I mean, I definitely wanted to know how to drive a car, but I never felt the intense urge to finally get their own car that I know a lot of people my age felt. This gives me hope that our generation can turn around and stop polluting our planet because the more that the “sweet sixteen” isn’t revered as a birthday to FINALLY own a car and essentially gain autonomy, the more that future generations will stop thinking of cars as a “right” that they deserve to own.

I also relate to your feeling of being "stuck" at home without a car growing up in a more suburban area. The day I got my drivers license I felt the freest I'd had ever felt until that day because it felt like the only key to getting to the places and things I wanted to go do. As much as my own parents and their generation has idolized the idea of raising a family in suburbia, with huge houses and lawns, wide streets that children can play in, plenty of space for whatever, etc. I personally would want my hypothetical children to grow up in a city. I don't want them, or any child, to be tied down to a house far away from anything. I would want for them to be able to take public transport and walk through lively neighborhoods, go to museums and meet with friends without relying on a car, and experience all the freedom that living in a city can provide. I also agree with all the positive aspects of living in micro-apartments that you stated. My first thought is that a smaller living space would award me less time and effort in cleaning and up-keep. They are less expensive the smaller they are. I also love the idea of living near people and having a community of neighbors all around you, rather than big houses spread apart, potentially not knowing who lives next door. Maybe its because I am young but I also love the thought of living in micro-apartments because unlike buying a house, I would be able to pick up and move if I wanted to. It is important to me, at least in my 20s, to not be tied down to a mortgage or even a living space with lots of furniture and things that would make it more difficult to move and pursue different career ventures or desires to live in different cities. This may be because most of us are college students already living in very cramped, densely populated housing situations, but I have become much more comfortable with this idea after living with multiple roommates and sharing living spaces for three years. In fact, when I go home to my childhood home, I feel very lonely and uncomfortable with how big it feels. There are things and pieces of furniture in there that I have forgotten exist for years, because they sit in the same place and are completely unnecessary and just taking up space. It honestly makes me sad: the feeling of empty rooms and spaces in a two-story house my parents took out multiple mortgages on, spending decades of their life paying it off, wanting to move to other states and be closer to family but not being able to -- all for the kids to grow up and leave all this room behind. That's a future I don't want for myself and one that can't happen if we are going to save the planet.

This lecture video was so interesting as it made points that I was really not expecting. I saw that the video was on housing and I assumed there would be a message of getting back to nature and simplicity, little did I know that this was exactly what the lecture ended up presenting as the worst solution of them all. We look at cities and their infrastructure and we associate them with pollution, overcrowding, and everything environmentally un-conscious. I had these biases and was so shocked when Ken said that moving out of the cities was one of the worst things we can do. It makes so much sense that instead of fleeing what we see as an environmental hazard, we should make changes to make it the environmental haven we think escaping will bring us. 

        <br><br>



This concept of co-housing was very intriguing to me as it seems like a really cool and beneficial solution. I think that it is not only a good concept because of how much better it is for the environment, but also because I think it could be very beneficial to human relations in society, and bring a new healthier outlook on living norms. I also pictured this concept to occur in some sort of commune hidden away in nature, but I realize that this could be normalized to occur in cities where we need it most. 



        <br><br>

The concept of micro-apartments and tiny houses is also such an interesting concept. I feel as though the triple I live in right now is the ultimate tiny house. It is true though, I was nervous about how it would be living in such close proximity with two strangers, but it has turned out to be really painless and actually doable. Yes it is uncomfortable sometimes and sacrifices need to be made, but I think this concept is less insane than most think. It really is all about necessity, and our huge American homes are about everything but that.

I also found it surprising to hear that cities would be the best alternative for housing that we may not be accustomed to currently and that instead of avoiding it, we should prioritize it to reduce our carbon footprint. With smaller area apartments or homes in the  city, we would greatly reduce the emission amount in comparison to a much larger sized house in the suburbs that would produce the 80 metric ton emissions when a house is built. 
        <br><br>

What Ken said about this being a movement of cultural change is the greatest emphasis I place upon my consideration of this approach as it is ultimately up to people to view this as socially acceptable and normal in order for it to be popularized among the masses. By encouraging such styles of living, it would become more comfortable for people to accept and encourage production/manufacturing of these smaller homes among cities.
        <br><br>

I like how you pointed out that co-housing would be beneficial to human relations in society and bring a healthier outlook as it would increase interactions and relations between people in a different way that would promote this new image of what cities can offer. I personally think micro apartments are a very interesting idea, and I honestly would consider living in one; However, the availability of such types of micro homes would be my greatest concern for the fact if they are even existing within the cities for me to purchase and live in. If cities and housing companies were to accept these types of micro housing layouts then they would be able to increase its production and make it popular, which would allow people to have the option to move in to them as an alternative to suburbs. By making them profitable and demonstrating its benefits in reducing one’s carbon emissions, such a housing movement would be a monumental transition.

This week’s lecture video interested me because I too would like to choir real estate in the future. I feel as if we haven’t brought up with a little homework, which is very low square footage, I can be close to nature in many other ways. The houses are tiny, one bedroom and bathroom and they’re relatively good expensive to buy. You can put them anywhere where you can get land, and they are a very efficient use of space. I would never want to Live in a shitty environment personally. I feel overwhelmed, just being in the city for a day. If we can make this more eco-village is near nature Danielle income, we can still go to outfit from vehicles, have a strong biking community or another source of transportation, and in your nature. I feel as if people need to escape the city alone cost of CO2 emissions from owning a car to travel to destinations.

The actions that you can do every day can also promote this change-such as reducing the number of driving and flying, switching to "green" energy providers, and changing your eating and shopping habits. Of course, the issue of climate change will not be solved because of your personal shopping or driving habits, but many experts believe that this is important and can affect others (sooner or later) and make corresponding changes, while other necessary changes can only be made in one place. Larger and more systematic levels, such as changing the subsidy system for funding the energy and food industries (the system is still encouraging the development of fossil fuels), or designing new regulations and regulations for industries such as agriculture, logging, and waste recycling Incentives.

This housing movement has interested me for a while. I would think to myself as I watched videos about housing alternatives like tiny houses, communal living, van-life, and more: things would be way cheaper and people would be happier and have more fun with this. I think we all need to take the time, as young people, to experiment with ways of living like Thoreau did. People might look at these situations like they are bizarre and lack the substance they want for their lives, but, as it has been stated many times throughout this course, this is just because of the consuming culture that has been beat into our minds. 
        <br><br>


When I was in high school, I took AP Environmental Science and, weirdly, we didn’t talk about climate change until closer to the end of the school year. We watched a movie called Earth 2100. This film revolved around a girl named Lucy, who was in the midst of an apocalyptic world due to climate change, regarding sea level-rise. The solutions to their problems were to build infrastructure—newly designed cities—kind of like a green metropolis. On balconies and roofs of apartments there were gardens and vegetation growing. Everything was produced by the people and for the people. There was clean transit and power and they worked on an ocean barrier for rising seas. It was interesting to see these people in the face of panic build things and event things so quickly, but they seemed to do these things when it was already bad—it was too late. Ancient diseases came back to life creating pandemics, technology stopped working, governments lost control, the world’s population began to shrink, and everything that they built just a tad too late, started to deteriorate. It was so interesting because it showed us what we could do if we were in this situation (which we are) but what happens if we only truly act when things are crumbling fast before our eyes. I don’t want to get to that point, but it worries me that we will.

I loved reading your comment and how you used an example of the movie, 'Earth 2100'. I think as much as it's scary to think of an apocalyptic future, it's the reality we have to be prepared for at this point in the climate crisis. We can't afford at the rate were going, and because housing is having such a big impact and percent of our climate footprint, we have to change. Unlike you, I never really thought about the housing movement, I feel like my mind in consumed with how we eat and how we use transport and those effects on the climate crisis. I think this is a result of our society and the constant pressures to switch to electric cars, buy solar panels, and eat at vegan cafes.
        <br><br>
I remember watching the show, "Tiny Homes", with my mom on HGTV and thought to myself I could never do that and that would suck, why are people choosing to live in a cramped trailer. Now that I have watched Ken's lecture video and the documentary I realized that there isn no reason to use all this carbon to build and sustain our homes, especially because of the growth of homes over time. Ken stated that since 1950 the average home went from about 1000 square feet to now about 2500 square feet, and even worse, the average family is smaller today!
        <br><br>
This housing video reminds me that the solution to the climate crisis truly comes down to a culture change. The American people, including me, need to stay away the idea that bigger is better. If we shift to co-housing we can spend more time building relationships and enjoying the beauties of our lives, like planting a garden and cooking a meal together. It's a win-win situation, because think of all the stress that would be forgone without paying for huge houses.

I love your comment. I like the story you told. I have also thought about housing a lot. I have done so much research and watched so many different housing shows. Its crazy how much space is water on peoples luxury homes and how many resources are not needed. I think we all should definitely consider a self sustaining lifestyle.
<br><hr>
the housing movement has been interesting to me too--especially after having experienced dorm life for the first time here on campus. Sharing my space in a relatively small room, has been extremely eye-opening for me and I find myself enjoying it far beyond my expectations. I think more people would feel this way too if they broaden their horizons and gave it a shot and had a positive mindset.
        <br><br>
I also took AP Environmental Science in high school and my teacher did discuss climate change throughout the course, but we learned more about the greenhouse effect and carbon emissions that we did about the political aspects and the personal lifestyle changes that we could/should make in order to combat the climate crisis. Considering the title of the course, I would have expected my teacher to touch more upon the actual crisis itself.
        <br><br>
I share your worrisome feelings for the health of our planet and the future of our environment. I think it's important for us to think about the ‘what ifs’ and the different possibilities that may result from our current actions, even though it may be scary and overwhelming to think about in a time in which we cannot be completely certain of the future of our planet.

In the lecture, “Housing and cities”, it distinguishes how hen the average house land  size was less than 1,00 square feet and now is more than 2,500 sq. ft. It distinguishes howas the year progresses the land of the house gets bigger. It was interesting about 17% of the average American is responsible for heating and cooling and 15% of footprint  for other usage like lights and other sources. It is insane how much houses can make an impact with the gas emissions. I wouldn't think that housing is a big factor and it open my eyes to realize how the world is being affected with these kind of conditions.14-16% is from the food that we eat and to determine how a big effect it has on the world. It enocurages me to not go shopping for unnecessary food items or things in general. I would also go grocery shopping when I am hungry, so this plays a big factor as well.In addition, it distinguishes how many cities are well known for the apartments and how it is around 185 square feet. This is a solution to reduce the gas emissions and reduce the size of the house which can make an improvement to the world.

I agree with you that this lecture is eye opening since it tells us how drastically our housing is impacting the climate. The housing size of average Americans is multiple times larger than that of average Japanese. Imaging how much portion of our carbon footprint we can save if we can reduce our housing size by a factor of ten. Wouldn’t it be amazing? In addition to the construction of our houses, power used in our appliances and cooling or heating is another huge chunk of carbon emission. Micro-housing and co-housing could be the most effective ways to reduce our carbon footprint in terms of housing. They both makes our space more efficient by cutting down the space that we don’t use quite often and shrinking the size of regular space without impacting too much of our daily life or causing too much inconvenience. In particular, co-housing enable us to do many things as a community such that we can save much space for laundry and kitchen. Other than these, moving into a city could be far better that living in suburbs or rural areas because the energy efficiency in cities are much greater.

There are some good points in this comment. I did not know about the amount of emissions we give off just by living in a house. Realistically people don't need huge homes to live in and can instead be fine with living in an apartment or something more ecologically friendly. It is depressing that most of Americans have been caught up in living the American dream and believing that bigger is better when in reality we don't need material things as much as we think. We can be happy without them and if we make a change we can feel better about ourselves because we are not polluting as much because of our choices.

It is interesting to note that 32% of the average American’s climate footprint comes from our homes, cars and flying cause 28%, and our “relentless acquisition of stuff,” as Ken says, is 26%. These numbers clearly portray where we as a population can change to mitigate our personal and overall footprint. 14% to 16% of our footprints come from food. Although eating a largely plant based diet is important, it is even more important to minimize the things we use or live in, in our daily lives. 
        <br><br>

To me, city living is very enticing. I have always wanted to live in New York City, and now I would like to even more based on the fact that I know it would reduce my climate footprint. Taking the subway, rather than a car, and living in a smaller city apartment would dramatically reduce my climate footprint. In the last documentary, it was noted that living for the environment actually makes you happier. So, while assisting in the climate crisis, one would also be happier personally. I am very glad that there is one of the biggest cultural shifts of our time surrounding the movement of people to cities. 
        <br><br>

Micro-apartments, co-housing communities, and re-greening are all things I would like to learn a lot more about, and I think that others should too. Aside from being environmentally friendly, they seem like a perfect way to simplify and purify our lives. It will rid us of the useless items we own so we can focus on the necessary, and help the planet at the same time. I think they are each very important and “effective” in the realm of climate activism. Instead of people, like me, hearing about them for the first time recently, we need to make sure people are aware of these and the great effects they would have on your life and in helping the climate.

Just by living in an average home (~2500sqft) blows your COP21 allotment for the next 2.5 years. It isn’t hard to fix the highest sector of your carbon footprint (32% compared to going plant based with just about 14-16%). Just move to the city and live with other people, although cultural change will make that easier still. Good thing is there’s already a shift, from “back to wilderness” of the generation before to things like micro apartments, smaller homes (like the ones on TV shows) and living with more people due to rising costs of homes. The dyad of “wildnerness vs culture” doesn’t have to be that way. Thoreau and Foreman purported this idea, causing environmental devastation, from people moving into nature to “ecodestruction”. I would love to bring nature into the cities and suburbs. Make things from things that are already there. Instead of building “greenhomes,” (which would probably take like 80tons CO2), turn old homes into greenhomes. Gardening seems like a fun thing to do and to develop communities as well as increase food security. It further decreases carbon output from transport of food. And people have a greater appreciation for their food. One thing about the micro apartments though, I agree with Ken that it’s still a rugged individualism thing. Living alone. Needlessly buying home appliances which could just be shared. Increasing your waste. Like, are you really going to be using your washer that often? I think cohousing is great. It’s not just  a lovely idea, it’s already a thing. Aren’t college students in dorms already doing that? My friends and I are planning to cohouse in our home city to decrease the cost of living and live together. Less money, more time, more happiness. I can’t wait.

I remember the time when my father had to find a place to stay when my mom and dad separated. I remember my father telling me how expensive San Francisco's apartments were and how the rent in California is just becoming extremely expensive. However, I remember one important part of that conversation, and that was co-housing apartments in San Francisco. My dad HATED that, he complained how fairly cheap it was, yet it bothered him that he had to share the bathroom with the other residents and how "nasty" it was. He also complained the size of the rooms and assumed that the apartment quality was "lacking and probably unkempt" just because it was CO-HOUSING. Look, I understand that privacy is important, but is it REALLY nasty to share just the bathroom with other people? When in reality we basically share a bathroom EVERYDAY with strangers in different buildings? I understand the circumstances are different, such as a shower and changing and "taboo" bathroom topics, but really it is almost all the same. I actually wouldn't mind doing co-housing, heck, college is BASICALLY co-housing. Sure, I want my own private bedroom, but honestly, sharing spaces with other people does not bother me at all.

        <br><br>

The only thing that bothers me here is the idea is moving to a city. I'm BARELY a city person, coming from a small town in Northern California, I am so used to and happy with the easy access to nature. However, because I have so many family members in the big cities such as San Francisco and LA, I basically grew up in both worlds. I am not sure if moving to a city is the BEST answer for everyone, especially because of the studies of cities being the worst places for mental health, with the overcrowded atmosphere, the traffic, etc.. I think co-housing is a WONDERFUL solution towards lowering carbon emissions, but moving to a city may not be the best option for everyone who wants to have a connection to nature and escape the craziness that are cities. For my friends and I, we go on long trips to forests and lakes just to escape our small town and we all wish to have a cabin like Thoreau, and that is because we enjoy being one with nature and ignoring life for awhile. Now, if we can somehow, like Ken said, start combining nature with cities and have more nature parts for people in those cities to enjoy, I would feel more open to moving to a city with co-housing.

Growing up, I imagined having an enormous kitchen with every appliance imagined. I wanted a 4 bedroom house, a good sized backyard that would fit a pool, and decor that would suit my fancy. I attribute those dreams to my parents because it was the norm. Now, I envy the traditional Japanese home. Small yet effective. Today, my dream house is actually some sort of “tiny house” or micro apartment. This house would be equipped with multi use spaces, a backyard with my own garden and fruit trees, and near bike path lanes so I can get around easily. My dream house now is influenced by my introverted personality, the want to live a meaningful and clutter free life, and the climate crisis. 
        <br><br>


What shocked me about this lecture is that 32% of our greenhouse gas emissions come to our houses today and that doesn’t even include the process of building the house. And a whopping 86% of our carbon footprint is a result of transportation, housing, and the accumulation of our stuff. Therefore, as Ken states, our society needs to approach this as a cultural problem; increase insulation, the addition of PV solar panels, move to micro apartments, and even moving to a city. Essentially we need to reduce everything that is unnecessary, so why not turn our extra yard space into something productive such as gardens. Co-living and community kitchens were also offered and while I will do whatever it takes to help, I cannot help but think that sounds like a nightmare to first find people that are compatible with me. Community gardens on the other hand I am all on board with. The fact that people can have a plot of land and grow their own food sounds like a solution not only for the food insecure but also recognizing how much time and effort into the food you eat. 

        <br><br>

I too always thought that cities were environmental disasters and it wasn’t until this lecture that I learned that it is quite the opposite (in some cases of course). Therefore, when Ken mentioned that activists are now bringing nature to the cities by replacing rooftops with gardens and having chickens in their backyards, I immediately thought, “what else can we do?”. Just by envisioning a culture with nature and acting upon the knowledge, we can slowly make a cultural shift (yes, I know we don’t necessarily have the time to go slow though).

I connected with you so much on this. I was raised in a low income household, which had a relatively small apartment, so I wanted a huge house growing up. I would look up the nicest homes that had like 6 bedrooms, a big pool, etc. Then, I got older and, like you, began to realize that that’s not the vibe. I have an obsession with the tiny house movement and cottages now but those are the types of places I want to live in. My dream is to live in a nice small home near a river and to grow a nice garden. 

        <br><br>

Having such a large home is definitely a waste of useful space. It definitely looks nice, and I suppose if you’re very claustrophobic it works out well, but other than that what use does it truly have? I’ll be honest that I’m a bit conflicted because I’ve always believed that people should be allowed to want nice things. But now I realize it’s because of consumer culture and this influence on our society to even want these big homes. Have a pool? Turn that space into a garden or even a workspace for making DIYs. People are growing up believing that they actually need to have a bigger and better home than others, but what justice is it really going to serve? A small apartment or home is fine (I understand bigger families want bigger homes though). Living in LA, I’ve never thought of the possibility of a city being environmentally friendly, but it makes sense for cities to be able to try. Cities house using apartments and I think putting solar panels on the apartment buildings would be really effective.

I feel like this is very relatable for many people in our generation. When I was younger I of course also dreamed of having a huge house with acres of land. However, I can now understand that these kinds of desires can be harmful. I am now fascinated by the tiny house movement, and movements similar, because I have realized that that is all you really need. I think these movements are very inspiring and have the power to make such a big difference in the climate crisis. While I obviously still understand the appeal of having a big house and a lot of space, I now see it as unnecessary. I was also surprised when I first learned that cities can be so environmentally friendly because I feel like we have always been taught the opposite. I think that this is something that more people need to know because it could make a difference. Overall, I admire these housing movements for many reasons, including the environmental benefits but also social benefits such as affordable housing.


<br><hr>
I feel so relatable reading your comment. I grew up in China where apartments are really common. Actually, I believe that the absolute majority of the housings in China is apartments because the population is just huge and there is no space for houses. Therefore, individual houses like the villas are just places where only rich people would purchase and live in. 

        <br><br>

I think the pursuit for housing are similar to that or automobiles. People desire bigger houses because they symbolize wealth, status, and in some sense independence in our modern societal values. When I was little, maybe in middle school, I always told my parents and friends that my biggest dream was to buy my own house in the suburb. I was a teenager back then, so this goal seemed to really reflect the social expectation and consumerist culture engrained in me. I would set “buying a descent, big house” as my life goal because that’s what adults around me have been directly or unconsciously affecting me by their consumerist philosophy. However, I didn’t feel discontented growing up in my apartment with my family. It’s just that “bigger is better” has been an almost universal ideology for people around the world, which needs to be changed. Competition also takes a role in this. It’s almost like an invisible hand pushing everyone to reach the end of the imaginary line by living in a desirable big house. You can’t just sit and watch all your friends get it before you do and make you look “inferior” if they live in big houses while you live in a co-housing apartment community. 

        <br><br>

Therefore, I feel like what people view as important in their lives matter because if this morbid culture isn’t debunked, the housing industry will remain the same just like the American car culture.


<br><hr>
I too agree with what you had to say. Most of my life I’ve been wanting to live in a giant home with a huge backyard, but now I would like to keep it simple. I think that living in a micro apartment would be a great way to help reduce our carbon emissions. It would be substantially cheaper due to its size, and would force you to only buy the necessities due to limited storage space. I lived in a small one bedroom home my whole life, so to me it wouldn’t be too difficult to live in a micro apartment. My parents would have the bedroom while my brother and I have to sleep in the living room. There, we have our bunk beds to sleep in. Though having bunk beds in the living room makes it feel a bit crowded, it is still fairly comfortable to live in. I currently dorm in a small double in manzanita village and let me tell you..it’s tiny. However, it is comfortable to live in if you are able to organize and use the space you have wisely. My roommate and I try to not have a lot of stuff in the dorm just so it feels less crowded. We both didn’t bring much stuff and everything fits perfectly. We even have so much extra room in the closet that we don’t need.

It is honestly really annoying that we as Americans are so materialistic that we purchase these lavish items that realistically we don't need in order to maintain a facade. When you think about it, more often than not these things aren't making you any happier, they aren't fixing a shitty situation you are in, and they certainly aren't helping you with relationships with other. So why do we prioritize this materialistic items, and in turn jeopardize our future? Thoreau's argument is still very much relevant because he was able to step back and realize that he didn't need as much of the things that people end up with. If we all just purged our home of things we haven't touched in years, we would realize that we actually don't need a ton of things to feel good about ourselves. The idea of co-housing was really interesting, but realistically I don't know how many people would be willing to give up their own homes to move and live communally. That being said I can see why there are co-housing communities and I'm sure they do a lot in reducing our carbon footprint in terms of housing.

I think Ken just demonstrated a great way to help our planet. I truly agree that the house size is a great contributor to the carbon footprint. Cooling and heating a big-sized house take a great amount of energy and releases a great amount of greenhouse gases. It is a fabulous idea to do co-housing, since the same amount of energy input could heat up the same sized house, but heated more people. If everyone was doing the co-housing, that is a HUGE reduction of human carbon footprint. Big living space makes a lot of spare space, and this space does not have any purpose. In other words, spare space in the house is a kind of waste. Co-housing could even reduce more spaces by sharing the same kitchen and bathroom. In my opinion, the idea of co-housing living style is very similar to college dorms. I need to agree with this, because dorming life is so fun and sharing rooms is a great experience.
         <br><br>

I am from New York, and I spent a couple summers in the New York City apartment. As Ken mentioned in the video, these apartments in New York City are typically smaller in size. However, buildings with thirty floors have a rooftop garden. It is the idea of "bringing nature to the city" these designs are great and many cities in the world need to adapt such living styles. Also, micro apartments and co-housing should be promoted further by the government.

Before I came to California, I spent one year in Japan as an exchange student for my middle school. It was really impressive the first time that I saw  a Japanese family lives in such a small home. My Japanese friend invited me to his house for staying two nights. There were five people which were his parents and his two sisters, and the house was less than 800 square feet. And they only have one single bathroom with a little bath tub. The most impressive thing is that they not only share a single bathtub, but also share the water. That means they wash their bodies in the same tub and the same water for all five people everyday. And they told me this is one of the customs of Japan. This is how they save water. I know it’s kind of unacceptable to many people; however, this method helps them save a lot of water. The size of their houses is also interesting. Even though the house is small, it does not affect their daily life at all. In some extend, the small size even helps keep their family together and enhance their love with each other because of good communication. Admittedly, the size of Japanese house is determined by Japan’s territory size. On the other hand, we still should not expand our house size any more only because of our bigger landscape. That is environmentally unfriendly and unwise.

Co-housing, as one of the solutions Ken has mentioned in the previous lecture videos, comes as the main topic of the lecture this week. As for the fact that each family is occupying more and more places as the family size is actually decreasing, the carbon footprints per person have risen dramatically. In order to keep the house runs well, a lot of greenhouse gases are generated in between. Therefore, an awesome solution concerning this issue is to move to co-housing tiny apartments in cities, so that carbon footprints per person will dramatically decrease because of the increasing use of public transportation and less energy in keeping the tiny apartment to operate well.  Speaking of living in a small-size area, I am proud of the Chinese living style. Since we have a huge population, but not many lands for us to live, almost all the Chinese people live in small apartments. And of course I’m pretty sure living in cities is a great way to solve the problem we are now facing. The public transportation system is extremely complete and sophisticated in China. I can take the metro or bus to almost anywhere I want to go. Therefore, even if I got my driver's license soon after my 18th birthday, I barely drive around the city, since it’s apparently cheaper and more convenient to go around the city by bus and metro. And for housing, we only need a small heater in winter to make the whole room warm, and that makes the carbon footprints for each one of us in our home decrease. So overall, moving to cities is really a good idea, and it can apply to reality perfectly. So why not just go ahead and take action now.

This week's  lecture video "Housing and Cites" was very eye-opening to the fact that every decision we make has a major impact on the world, even all the way down to the place we live in. Although it was kind of apparent that the housing we choose to live in has a negative impact, I wasn't aware as to how major that impact was and how much it actually affects the environment. One of the intriguing things that I got from this video was the idea of "Co-Housing" and how it challenges this tradition of individualism. The sheer fact of sharing a household, appliances, sharing meals (4 or more times a week) is not only so profound and heartwarming to the point of bringing people together, but it is also saving the world one step at a time. I really like what you said about co-housing and it being a "very important part of the global movement towards cities as a form of environmental activism" because we need to hop on this movement as soon as possible because it is dire for this global movement.
         <br><br>
I believe that a lot of the issues we are facing as a nation in this global crisis, is an issue with what we perceive as the American Dream or even our  pride and egos because what many strive for in this country is an accumulation of capital, getting a bigger house, having more cars, and much more and our pride having been set on those goals makes us blind us to what the true goals are as a nation. We need to get over ourselves and get on and along with each other. We need to come together. We need to stop the urbanization  and industrial modernization of the little environment that we have left. We need to consolidate the idea that having less and living with less is MORE. We all need to incorporate these major minimalist mindsets within ourselves and many around us. Micro apartments are going to be the future (as it should be). One step at a time, we will save this planet.

I too was completely shocked to hear about the incredibly negative impact housing can have on the environment. I agree with you that a house has always been a huge part of the American Dream. For this reason, a huge cultural change must occur on how we view the American Dream. Being environmentally friendly, sustainable, and minimalist should be the new goal. I'm someone who scoffs at cities and always talks about leaving and moving to Hawaii to live an off the grid minimalist life. However, this goal of mine would  have drastic effects on the environment. After listening to this video, I'm starting to have a better appreciation for cities as they are going to be the future. Micro apartments, co-housing, and urban gardens seem like awesome solutions to our current housing problem.
<br><hr>

I completely agree with your point about our perceptions of happiness/attaining the American Dream equivocating to an accumulation of materialistic goods. Many of us have a hard time understanding that less is more when the majority of our lives have revolved around the ideology that being able to buy luxury things, specifically new things, was an indicator of success and fortune. As for the co-housing idea, I agree that family connection with a shared household would not be severed and actually has the capability of being enhanced. There's this misconception that a smaller house means less room for alone time and privacy, thus creating a more tense or hostile environment for members of the family. This does not necessarily have to be the case at all, and a more enclosed environment can actually encourage confrontation of relationship issues rather than permit the option of escaping them by going into your room and shutting the door on your family member. Obviously, there are pros and cons to every situation but with this concept specifically, I think people are so quick to harshly judge it and turn down the idea without considering its mental benefits but more significantly the environmental benefits that it has on our planet.


<br><hr>
I also agree this video is very informative in showing the significant impacts our households have on the environment. It clears up the previous doubts I had on the environmental impact of refrigerators being the #1 contributor of climate change I learned about a few weeks ago. It is incredible how a single American household (which is increasing in size over time) can disrupt a person's carbon allotment by at least 2.5 times. This statistic is align with the refrigerator data because it includes the footprint of household appliances. I think it is important for people to culturally adapt to the idea of "co-housing", espeically in cities because living in cities is the most energy efficient way of living. I see hope as there are already concepts of "co-housed" microapartments in enormous cities like new york city that utilize space to ensure more occupancy and directly reducing the carbon footprint per capita.

<br><hr>
I agree with how one of the problems with our nation is the need to just have more and more material thing such as bigger house or multiple cars. All around my neighborhood I see more and more development of houses and apartment complexes that are often left vacant for some time. I think so many people are focused on building more and more in the hopes of making a profit that the don't often see the side effects of it. I have seen so many places in my town be built up only to be left empty for a year or two serving now purpose and it angers me that areas that once had planets and trees were bulldozed just to build another empty strip mall.

I think the government can intervene in the issue of the size of a house. I believe if the price of buying a huge house is not affordable, people will decrease the demand for it. In the contrast, if living in a city or living in a small department is cheap, more people will willing to do so. By doing this, can encourage people to live in small houses which can reduce their personal carbon footprint. In addition, people should have a better understanding of the uselessness of living in a huge house. From my perspective, a house is big enough as long as it contains a bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen. Even though the house is considerably huge, extra spaces are meaningless for me. Therefore, I only need a certain area of space for my house. If everyone can have this thought, more people are willing to buy smaller houses instead of big houses.

I 100% agree. Urbanization is increasing at an accelerated rate making things like co-living and downsizing a much more realistic option for many people. I think if we wanted to encourage it to happen faster or more readily, that working on making urban housing options cheaper and more equitable, while making larger and more resource and land intensive developments more expensive, would be the best option. Additionally, working on “greening” cities, I think, is really important. I grew up in Seattle, and it is probably the greenest city I have ever been to, as far as being filled with trees and green spaces. Also, I grew a garden every year in our small backyard and raised chickens, feeding them mainly from the yard and recycling their waste back into the garden. I think the development of more local food systems is very important, however, it isn’t something a lot of people will be willing to do themselves.

         <br><br>


This simply is not true.

         <br><br>

I notice a profound misunderstanding of what Capitalism is amongst my generation. Some of my peers seem to lack nuance when it comes to their perception of Capitalism. We have praised Denmark in this class numerous times (perhaps rightly so) for its efforts in combating the climate crisis. But guess what, Denmark IS itself a Capitalist country. Denmark has a free market (albeit regulated), its economy has profits and price markers, and its institutions recognize the legitimacy of private property. 
         <br><br>


So what is the problem?

         <br><br>

The problem is that we have made Capitalism into the ultimate boogeyman without understanding that this economic system can be applied in drastically different ways. Capitalism in the United-States is applied much differently than in countries like Denmark, France, South Korea, or Japan (to name a few). The issue in the US is lack of government regulation and a morally twisted vision of profits and wealth. Denmark is a good example of how capitalism can co-exist with environmental goals and social prosperity.

         <br><br>

I think Professor Hiltner has also been guilty of lacking nuance in some of his statements regarding Capitalism and private corporations. Prof. Hiltner is undoubtedly a very intelligent man, but he unfairly qualified the Great Recession of 2008 as being “caused by corporate interests” (This was said around week 3 and may not be exactly right so feel free to correct me). This, again, is wrong. The GR of 2008 was a complex phenomenon caused by an intersection of different agents and institutions. Banks, the federal government, the Federal Reserve, Wall Street, sellers and consumers (us)… All of these entities were responsible in different ways. 

         <br><br>

I say this to you now, my peers: Please, utilize nuance. Always question your professors and your peers (including myself). Do not fall prey to straw-man tactics and to flattering inaccuracies. 
         <br><br>
Thank you.

I'll gladly ride this tangent with you. I will agree with you in the fact that many people do not have an adequate understanding of what Capitalism is, neither at its theoretical core nor for its practical applications in driving the mechanisms of our global society. A lot of young people, including myself, associate Capitalism with the ailments of the world due to the prioritization of market function, corporate interests, and deregulation coupled with the neglect of human rights, sovereignty, diversity of interest, and the natural environment. Whether or not most people who blame Capitalism really understand the "nuances" of the economic model, they are still correct in identifying the driver of climate change and socio-ecological injustice. Focusing too much on the "nuances" of a capitalist economy is an easy way to find outlier examples of capitalist economies that happen to function in a semi-sustainable and semi-equitable manner. However, the fact is that these cases are outliers. Additionally, focusing on these outlier cases (such as Denmark) is a failure to consider the global scope of the situation. We no longer live in a time where it is appropriate to look at a single country's economic model with no consideration of how it is influenced by and how it influences other countries via international politico-economic relationships. We do not live in isolated bubbles of countries anymore. We live in a globalized, capitalist world system. Countries are not run exclusively at the hands of their political leaders. They are HEAVILY influenced by transnational corporate activities which are able to use financial incentives to influence policy and decision-making. Don't let the tasty fruits of progress blind you from the poisoned roots which produced them. Capitalism, as an economic model, has imperialist and exploitative imperatives written into its code. No successful capitalist regime achieved its status without dominating a group of peoples and the natural environment they inhabited.

Being from the city of portland, oregon I have seen a lot of the changes that Ken suggest happen to California. For example we have a highly functioning train and bus station that limits the amount of people who use cars, we are known for being youth activists in climate change, as well as we make lifestyle choices that are in support of the climate. This goes off of this week’s lecture and readings because Portland is known for being vegan and vegetarian as well as being a city that works on making more micro housing. From this personal experience I have seen how easy the shift is and how much of a positive impact it makes.
          <br><br>

I was shocked when I found out that thirty-two percent of our carbon footprint comes from our houses. I never realized that our thermometers and refrigeration have such a large impact. I hope that in the next few years we can lower those emissions. I also agree that we should increase micro housing and eco housing because people who live alone do not need so many square feet and they will have been physical health if they live with others.

yeah housing plays a huge role in our carbon footprints. It is important for us to mitigate this aspect of society because the U.S is building more and bigger houses. Personally, living in Isla Vista with 3 other roommates is an ideal housing system for us. We are able to cut the rent while also lowering our carbon emissions by having so many unnecessary things in a bigger home. Hence Ken emphasizes micro-apartments because it can allow us to lower emissions, especially in cities.  

          <br><br>

I am interested in what specific transportation systems are in Portland that California does not have. If it is so accessible for Portland residents to use a new means of transportation, California should be able to as well. I think renovating housing and transportation system to accommodate sustainability can be transcending.

I found this lecture video intriguing and the idea of co-housing interesting. While I think co-housing would be a great option to help reduce our personal carbon footprints, I do not think it is a plausible option that people will be willing to take. It seems easy to think about the idea of co-housing right now and doesn’t seem like a bad idea. However, when the time comes to actually do it, I don’t think many people would be willing to share their personal space with other people. While I want to do everything possible to help reduce my own carbon footprint, I don’t think I would even be willing to participate in the idea of co-housing myself. However, I do agree with the idea of reducing housing sizes and migrating to a city lifestyle. I think these options can have a great effect just like co-housing and would be something more people would be willing to do. Reducing the size of our homes is a much more realistic option than co-housing because we would still have our own personal space. While it may not be as effective, I think it would be successful in moving towards the right direction to fix the issue at hand. Migrating to a city is also a great idea and something that I myself would be willing to do. City life is seen as hectic sometimes but overall is much more effective. Houses are already smaller in size, transportation would be reduced, and we would be closer to everything around us. I do however believe that the options of reducing house sizes and migrating to the cities will be a challenge as well. Many people are not going to be willing to pick up everything they have worked for and completely change their lifestyles. This is especially true with older people. These older people typically will not want to move out of their current homes because of the time it takes and some of their current views on the climate crisis. I think it is crucial for us to make a change regarding the housing topic, but I believe it will be a difficult one because many people have not opened their eyes to the idea of it.

I fully agree with your pain point that most people are not going to embrace co-housing. Similar to you, I am willing to stake steps to reduce my carbon footprint, and I have taken many things from this class that I want to incorporate into my lifestyle, there is simply no way I am going to ever commit to co-housing as a long term part of my lifestyle. While I think downsizing is reasonable, especially if energy costs go up as a result of tax incentives and regulations, I don't see many people willfully co-housing or supporting any sort of mandate. The idea of one-family households is too big of a part of American culture. While I do think over time we can shift the American dream of suburban living to smaller, more sustainable living, I think discussing co-housing at this point is more than a little far fetched. 
          <br><br>
While in theory co-housing would do a lot to reduce our CO2, if no one actually does it, the time and political capital wasted on advocating for it ends up amounting to nothing. I understand that these types of proposals are supposed to be drastic in order to be thought-provoking, I think bringing up such radical ideas runs the risk of turning people away from action since it constantly seems like we are not doing enough unless we take the most drastic action possible. I think on both a personal and political level we should be realistic regarding what we can actually accomplish, and focus our energy on convincing the broadest group of people to follow along and support whatever action we take.

An issue that I see with the situation of homes here in the United States is the cost, as for example, the median home cost in New York City as of 2019 was $680,500 for a average size apartment (850 sq. ft) in lower Manhattan in comparison to median home cost Texas as of 2019 which was $195,000 for an average home (2,068 sq. ft) which is quite large in size overall. Though yes, moving to the greater cities is a great solution to the climate crisis where everything is more convenient and commuting is far more popular than travelling by car, the major push away factor for many average Americans is the general cost  it takes to even live with in greater cities of the United States which is also why theirs a ever growing desire for people to look for larger homes for a quarter of the price as we see in greater areas like Texas. The culture of the United States stands by this idea that our persona is defined by our possessions we have from clothing, phones, cars and even your home where location and size matters as we developed into this state of mind that "Bigger is Better", and tell me you haven't heard that slogan thrown around the United States in any sector or size. But I digress, I still believe that the cities are the right direction towards fighting the climate crisis by prioritizing convenience in travel and commuting in comparison to long distance travel of commutes, but what I see as a great idea is implementing much of these similar techniques used in cities in rural United States by expanding on renewable energies, expanding on transportation system and a greater expansion of co-housing and housing blocs which can expand on the fight against the climate change and this greater idea that "bigger is better". The fight against this idea that your own personal image is based on what possessions you own and surround yourself with is a problem more complex than the fields of studies that I am voyaging on, however I believe that the change in this image would be the hardest to budge. This image has become what it means to be an American and it's something I hate to agree with as personally, I have always wanted a small cozy home near a body of water, yet this image of Mansions dominate the face of the United States. Take MTV Cribs from the early 2000s, this modeled and prioritized famous figures on the media with their mansion styled homes and there grand possessions from clothing to cars which stunned most people growing up and forged this desire to be like them, rich and living in high prestigious lifestyles which we all desired at some point in our lives and some longer than others. This issue is embedded in the United States behind the major capitalist lifestyles we have all grown up  living under.

I definitely agree that the cost of housing in certain cities pose a major issue when considering moving to one. The cost of living overall is often much cheaper as well in more rural areas, making it more difficult for one to make the transition from these areas to urban ones. In addition, the notion that “bigger is better” is often perpetuated in America and dominates people’s goals in life. Once again, mitigation of climate change will require a transformation of American culture and a new perspective on what it means to be successful. My hometown, Irvine, is a very suburban area, and big houses are becoming increasingly more popular. As Ken mentioned, the average size of American houses are now about 2,000 square feet while ⅕ of houses are over 3,000 square feet, and I can clearly see this in Irvine. Companies continue to clear empty land for the purpose of building homes, and all of these houses are excessively large, with no apartments in sight. In new neighborhoods, houses now have up to 3 stories with so many rooms that are only necessary for bigger families. While cities are already on the right track, I think it is going to be difficult to change the culture of houses in suburban and rural areas.

Housing contributing around 32% of a persons carbon footprint is a significant force that has to be reduced if we want to be productive in reaching a solution for the climate crisis. While the idea of micro apartments sounds great in theory, convincing people to either leave their much larger homes or to believe that less can be more is a much more difficult task than we realize. Having been groomed for so long to fit into our consumer culture, we are much less likely to see the flaw in our ways since it has been commonplace for so long. For those who will not agree to move into a smaller space or for who it isn't realistic, solutions like further insulating homes and incorporating solar energy are a good way to still reduce their impact. The volume of our emissions that housing contributes needs to be communicated to a broader range of people because I had no idea how significant it was until learning about it in this class. If more people understood that compromising their dream house slightly can reduce their impact on our severely damaged environment, I think there would be much more willingness to change.

I agree with you that we must reduce housing if we want to solve the climate crisis. But while the idea of micro-apartments in the video sounds great in theory, it's not feasible in practice. First, persuading people to either leave their big houses is a harder task than we might think. People have already lived in such big houses for a long time, they cannot understand these micro-apartments. Second, a lot of big houses have been built, we still need to spend the cost to tear them down, which will also release a lot of pollution and carbon dioxide. Lastly, on this basis, people will only want to live in micro-apartments if the government offers them generous compensation or subsidies to buy houses. However, if governments want to cover such expenditure, they need to increase taxes. Then, our whole society will gain less for paying environmental change. But if we want to solve this problem, it is not only the government that needs to take action but also people need to understand environmental problems. This requires people to publicize and tell others about environmental problems so that people will be aware of and take action to protect the environment.

I am amazed by the number that transportation, housing, and stuffy we purchased account for 86% of our footprint. Ideas of minimalism and less driving and more public transportations are emphasized previously. What we can deal with the problem of housing is moving to a city or living in cohousing. I never think that living in a city could help mitigate the emissions of greenhouse gases because when I relate to “city”, I would think of “people”, “cars”, and a lot of “buildings”.  However, there is a current movement and belief that people tend to move to rural to seek “simple” life and get away from the hustle and bustle of city. In this case, I believe that this kind of beliefs should be eliminated like customer culture. People should rethink about this and do actions that could benefit the environment and climate, or at least do not hurt and deteriorate the issue. In my opinion, moving to a city and living in a small apartment is ideal and nice because it is convenient to go out even without a car. This action could not only benefit climate change and ourselves, but also be good for our future generation.

Trying to get people to move to micro apartments or communal housing is going to be the hardest challenge of all. Houses are personal spaces - places that families make into homes. Homes are places to come back to after a long day where you have no worries but yourself and the people you choose to invite in. Communal housing would close off opportunities to sprawl in your own home without so much peace. This is something even I found living in the dorms last year and in my sorority house this year - the thing I missed most about home was having a space to have as my own, and being able to have multiple rooms I could relax in. This is the closest to communal living that I have experienced but as a teen it wasn’t as bad. Having a family, and raising young children in a communal environment where you aren’t sure who your neighbors or suite mates will be, seems like a huge argument that will be put against this idea. While I think communal housing will be extremely hard to promote, I think micro-housing has a better chance of success. 
          <br><br>

I think that you could convince people to move into micro apartments easier because if you are still offering people the opportunity to have their own space then they will be more willing to cooproate. The idea of microapartments also comes with more outdoor communal spaces. This kind of communal space is much more appealing because it is a place for people to get outside, embrace the outdoors and socialize, while still having their own place to call home. While I certainly think it will be also challenging to call on people to live in microhousing, I think there are benefits to it, where we collectively return to the basics, living in smaller homes and spending more time outside.

I completely agree with your argument that micro-housing will be more readily incorporated into society over communal housing, where the promise of eternal privacy and comfortability is compromised. I also felt the same longing for my more spacious and isolating home last year when I lived in the dorms. However, now that I think about it, it was a blessing in disguise. Because I felt so constricted in my crammed space, I forced myself to go outside much more frequently, entailing memorable adventures and friends made along the way. I think that not only will down-sizing reduce your carbon footprint, but will simultaneously enhance your relationships, with both the people around you and with the Earth. We can learn to appreciate all the simple beauty of merely living on this abundant planet if we have to associate ourselves with it more. I feel that we have transformed our living spaces into modern escapes from the outdoors, alienating ourselves with technology and socially constructed indoor aesthetics. 
          <br><br>


It is almost as if we are replacing the space filled by a backyard or favorite park to visit into more indoor square footage. I found it mind-boggling when Ken mentioned that 1 in 10 Americans own a McMansion (over 4000 square feet)! Who needs that much space, when you can go outside and enjoy the nature all around us?

I found this week’s lecture to be very interesting. I’m surprised by how over the past 70 years houses have increased in an average of 1000 square feet. I found this something to consider because along with this growth in the size of houses, we’ve also had exponential growth in our population. Where are all these people being housed if houses now are larger than seventy years ago? 
          <br><br>

Comparing the United States to other countries shows how relatively larger our homes are than others. I was surprised that the typical Japanese home is 1/10 the size of the houses here in the US. The US alone has such a large range in the size of houses, from mansions over 10,000 square feet to 300 square feet apartments in New York City. There seems to be disparities between the size of houses. 
          <br><br>

I didn’t know, before watching this, that housing was one of peoples largest carbon footprints; 32%, almost ⅓, of our carbon footprint comes from housing. It seemed like owning transportation had a smaller carbon footprint, as it was only 28% of our emissions, but Ken made a good point about the life or cars versus the life of a house. The fact that cars contribute 4x more CO2 than a house when spread over their lifetime took me by surprise. 
          <br><br>

My view on this whole matter though is that we can not all just move to a city and live in a 300 sq ft apartment. Cities would be overcrowded and unsanitary, the suburbs and countryside would be abandoned and vacant. It is important that we have mass transportation, but not at the cost of three hundred million people moving into five major cities. Beyond that, I think it’s many people's dreams to buy a house and raise a family, so I can’t imagine everyone jumping on board to live in micro apartments.

I completely agree. Until reading this comment, I never thought about the increase in housing size with the increase of population. You would think that housing would shrink, but sadly people don't care if they develop on purely natural land. We are depleting our forests and other untouched land in order to make bigger houses for people that don't need it. This is a very sad reality of the world, and especially America, today. 
          <br><br>

Unfortunately, this can be seen through the massive average size of an American versus the sizes of homes from other places. American's really do tend to believe that "bigger is better." This needs to change. Japanese homes are usually one tenth the size of the average American home, and they are flourishing. A big house is not the key to a successful or happy life, and people need to realize this. Cars, however, still contribute more emissions than houses, over the span of a lifetime. 
          <br><br>

I also agree that not everyone will want to move to a micro-apartment. People tend to feel strongly about the appearance of teh objects they own, and how they portray them as people. I think people equate success with a big house a lot of the time, as they do a fancy car or designer clothes. We need to break the stigma that successful people should live in large houses. I can hardly think of a celebrity that has a modest sized house. The huge mansions are not necessary, and cause more harm than good. I believe it is a good idea for everyone to try and downsize in many aspects of their lives, and especially housing.

After viewing this lecture video "Housing and cities' '. A quote said by a Nobel prize receiver from China Moyan once said, "as the earth is dying, humans are destroying ourselves, Literature is meaningless' '. Humans destroyed tons of trees to build a weird thing called city, we are basically killing ourselves by reaching the baseline of the nature world. In this lecture video, Ken states that, it's hilarious that the average area of the American housing is more than two thousands square feet, and some even reaches four thousands square feet, the professor also mentions that the average housing area in Japan is one tenth of it. This data can reflect a question on most people, do we really need a giant house to be comfortable. The carbon footprint that most American spend on is to cool or warm their house by using the Air conditioner.

<p>
In regards to the co-housing and micro-apartment phenomena as a form of climate activism, I believe it is actually a viable movement, but not necessarily by choice. It is no secret that the global population is on an exponential rise, and as a result, I envision places, mainly urban ones, becoming more and more overcrowded. This overpopulation will no doubt force people to live in smaller spaces or shared spaces . If this living style is not done out of lifestyle choice, it will probably happen by force because the cost of housing will also probably go up. This is not necessarily a bad thing in my mind however. I grew up in a suburban environment where I would constantly notice several of my friends' homes being abnormally large even though our families had the same number of people. I just don't think that people really need that much space to have a good standard of living. I often would notice that many of my friends had a formal dining room that would be used for nothing other than to house dirty laundry and host thanksgiving dinner once a year. Connecting back to the idea of minimalism, having less opportunity for irrelevant things can even allow one to become less stressed out mentally. In fact, living in a small dorm room at the moment, it's nice not to have to worry about maintaining any large home responsibilities at the end of a long day at school. Living in a community has also allowed me to meet some really cool friends. Ultimately, I believe that a shift towards smaller housing, especially in urban environments, is not only an environmentally friendly, but also cost effective and psychologically beneficial option for the majority of single living Americans.

I agree that the smooshed living situation of city life might not necessarily be a choice. As population grows, there is the need to take more advantage of the space one has. Like you, I'm from suburbs and felt the same way surrounded by the McMansions in my neighborhood and that of my friends. My house had three bedrooms, and as an only child, it felt like a lot of space. Not unappreciated space, but definitely not entirely necessary. My neighborhood is in the middle of all of the highways in San Diego, about ten minutes from downtown. So as the county has become more populated, and downtown or beach town living have become more condensed and expensive, giant apartment complexes began to appear everywhere throughout the suburbs, often next to schools and shopping centers. I recall these complexes as appealing, modern, and fancy, almost envying their accommodations and built in community. And while these spaces are taking more advantage of their space, I don't know if they're necessarily more environmentally friendly. Though they allow for a minimalistic approach to life, due to their location a tenant is still required travel costs, one of the major advantages of shared living in city spaces.
          <br><br>

I would agree with many on here saying city life is an intimidating and different change. Isla Vista life compared to what I imagine life in LA or Chicago to be is vastly different. Commuting, driving, shopping, exercising would all be very different to me, because with more people comes more anxiety as to my safety being surrounded by these people. Traffic accidents are more common, driving is more dangerous, going for a run alone is not the safest. I don't know what it would be like to have a family in a busy city. I think small house suburb living is much more appealing and comfortable. I also feel that I have a very limited perspective, and am open minded to a bunch of different living situations. When I think of my family in Missouri and the way their backyards stretch out, fenceless and as large as elementary school playgrounds, I realize that many people are accustomed to very different necessities of space, and asking everyone to stack into a box on top of one another seems like a difficult task to achieve.

I felt guilty while watching this lecture video, as someone who comes from a split family, and then a now mixed family of 6 people, we have a 4,200 square foot house. Growing up this seemed like a perfect size for my family, each kid was able to have their own room and space, and then with extras like a game room, and a reading room, and a piano room, which allowed anyone in my family to escape one another. But after listening to Ken speak about this it shows me how unnecessary some of this space can be. I definitely agree with the fact of everyone in my family having their own room, but are the extra rooms necessary. Even Though we have a bigger than average house, we also have a bigger than average family, but is now seen as unnecessary as all 4 kids are in college and it is now just my dad and step mom living there. I can though feel less guilty about this fact because 1. I was not the one who decided to buy the house, nor do I have any influence on what my parents decided to buy when I was 6 years old, and 2. We are trying to be more energy friendly when we decided to switch to solar power a few years ago. 
          <br><br>

I have always grown up in a very small tight knit community and Ken goes into talking about cities and the benefits of living within them and in apartments. Personally I cannot see myself living within a big city, I have always wanted to live in the rural United States, but do not plan on following my parents path. I would love to have a small family, if any family at all, and live in a small house, preferably a tiny house, which has been a dream of mine for a long time. All of our choices have some sort of either negative or positive effect on our environment, and we need to start thinking about these effects when making decisions in our lives. There is so much more knowledge and movements that are going around the world that are very doable and easy switches that have many positive effects for the environment, like the tiny house movement, or co-living.  I really liked all the living suggestions that Ken gave within this lecture and provided me with tips to follow even though I know I do not want to reside forever in a big city.

I also grew up in a huge home, we had guest bedrooms, a separate office for my dad, a huge backyard, a toy room, and so many different things. All this for my mom, my dad, my dog, and I. It was such an unnecessary amount of space for just the 3 of us (the dog was always in the backyard so I don’t think she counts), but it was so nice to have all this space to play and run around in. However nice it is to have an endless supply of space we barely used, I don’t plan on following my parent's footsteps. I believe my home should be a place for me to rest in, but not for me to spend copious amounts of time in. I want to travel and see the world, to go out with friends and family, go camping and so many other things. And for that I don’t think I need 5 bedrooms and 3 living rooms, I just need a bed, a shower, a kitchen, a living room and someone to share closet space with me.


<br><hr>
I also felt a certain level of guilt watching this video. My family lives in a pretty big house too and there are only four of us. While I always knew most people aren't lucky enough to live so comfortably, I never really felt bad for it because I never thought there was anything wrong with living in a big house. But watching this video made me realize that there are some many negative repercussions with huge homes that I had never realized. I hope that when I'm older and buy a house, that I'll remember what I learned in this video and try to make a conscious decision about the type of home I choose to live in.

Ken’s lecture did a great job and fundamentally changed my original opinion about cities and rural areas. When I finished reading Thoreau’s Walden before, I not only admired his experiment of reducing everyone unnecessary, but also his rustic and wild life. I once believed that living in rural areas is one approach to get closed to the nature and thus a good way to protect the environment. However, after so many lectures taught by Ken, I gain a new understanding of the importance of focusing on greening and nurturing the areas we have already developed and inhabited such as cities. 
          <br><br>

    Since 17% of Americans’ carbon footprint comes from heating and cooling our homes and 15% comes from other energy-related uses in the home, we need to reduce this part of carbon emissions. Living in cities could render more options of micro-apartment and co-housing communities than living in rural areas which are mostly occupied by large houses. Moreover, living in cities provides more possibilities for us to commute with public transportation system rather than cars because of its convenience and development comparing to that in rural areas. Mindlessly fleeing from cities would actually aggravate climate change because it brings more large houses and more use of cars to commute. I also learn the concept of the new way of environmental activism: greening cities. We could bring nature to cities and make them more environmentally-benign than suburbs and rural areas in numerous approaches such as living in micro apartment, commuting through mass transit, enjoying more choices of plant-based diet (cities generally have more restaurants) and so on. I really hope that this kind of environmental activism could reduce the building of new large houses in suburbs and rural areas, which could decrease hundreds of metric tons of CO2 emissions.

After I graduate from UC Santa Barbara, I would like to live in a green city like Portland where I can easily get around without a car, and enjoy the urban culture along with some natural greenery around me. While most major cities the U.S. are not as eco-friendly as Portland, I agree with Ken that it is important to “eco-nurture” these areas that we have already inhabited to their highest potential. It makes the most sense to sustainably upgrade infrastructure in developed and industrialized areas of the world that are already heavily populated. This is because green cities contain a dense nucleus of people, therefore, they have the most power to impact many inhabitants within a small region. Perhaps, moving from cities to rural areas in Thoreau’s time was more beneficial to society and the planet. However, the contemporary shift from urban to suburbia happens to be more detrimental in the modern day as it typically results in inhabitants taking up a surplus space of space with material objects and offsetting even more carbon emissions through car travel. Thus, those living in urban settings often have smaller eco-footprints.

I found this lecture video as a very simple concept to apply to my own life
because I have never been one to want a big house. The home that I grew up in
is a little over two thousand square feet but has taken care of my two parents,
myself, and my four other siblings for the past forty or so years. So if I do
the same math that Ken did with how many years it has been used with the amount
of people within it, the carbon footprint really isn’t too bad. In addition, my
house rarely uses the heater or A/C unless it is necessary. Since my childhood
home is close to LA, our summers feel as though they never end and it can make
our homes very hot. For the past ten or so years, my home has had a built in
fan that basically brings the outside air in and the inside air out very
quickly to cool your home down without having to use a lot of energy. This was
done due to the prices of electricity specifically when using the A/C being
high and my parents wanting a more cost efficient way of living. 


          <br><br>



When I move out of college and my childhood home, I plan on moving to a smaller home
and always have planned on doing so. My childish thoughts were always that if I
had a smaller home, I would have less to clean. Now looking at the situation, a
smaller home is better for the environment and myself. Cooling and heating my
home would be efficient and not have as large of a carbon footprint, I would be
making more room for other people to have homes beside me, and it would cost a
lot less meaning I would not have to be scraping by each month to see if I
could pay for all of my necessities. Plus, if I were to be living in a green
city, I could help to preserve the nature on this planet by voting to protect
our natural areas in those cities. I personally love going hiking in nature and
would love to do anything to help keep these areas of forests and greenery even
if it means to shrink down homes and city areas.

I agree with your comment about Ken’s view on housing and had a similar experience to you, growing up in a family of 6 and living in a decent sized house. My family also rarely used heating or AC, and I say this coming from Santa Clarita in southern California where it can get over 110 degrees in the summer. I think that unless you have a big family, there’s really no need to own a large house that sucks up tons of energy. It also depends on how much energy you use in your house. Like I mentioned, my parents rarely use heating/AC in our house and if you take into account that 6 people lived there, then it is reasonable. However, if it is just one person, then living in a housing unit or community living is a far better option both economically and environmentally. I’m not saying that we all should live in micro-apartments, but there’s no reason to have a 4000 square foot house for one or two people. 
<br><br>
 Thoreau inadvertently hurt the environment by moving to untouched nature. This is something we all should avoid. I used to think about moving out to a rural area, but I never realized how inadequate it was. Not only is it environmentally damaging, but it is not economically viable. I don’t know if I would live in a city necessarily, but living in a rural area is no longer an option I’m considering. Not to mention most people move to places based on where they work. Co-housing communities are great ways to live in a low rent area but not being isolated. I think I would be open to living in a community like this.

When Ken was saying that 32% of our carbon footprint comes from our homes (17% from heating and cooling plus 15% is other energy related things such as lighting) I was pretty surprised. Hearing the numbers and the total really had me thinking more about what I do at my house. Then Ken started talking about things like community housing and I've seen the video he included in the video because of English 22. The concept of community living in which people share a kitchen and meals is still so crazy to me. Huge props to those who do participate in community living because it seems like something really hard to do but regardless I think that's pretty cool. Micro apartments are also something that seem really cool but makes me wonder how realistic are these options for everyone, not just those who have the ability in terms of money to do so. Housing is such an important topic because we live in a world where many people don't have housing or struggle to pay for it. I think that again this one of the topics that should be largely aimed to those who believe that bigger is better and celebrities who own huge mansions and land. Seeing reality shows where celebrities like the Kardashians own huge places and are the living symbol for bigger is better makes me so angry because of how taxing it is on the environment.

I agree that the  percentages really put in perspective how big of an impact housing has on our personal emissions. I had never really thought of the impact of living in a suburban house growing up: my parents didn't, my friends didn't, so why should I? I honestly think a lot of people are oblivious to this problem and have never really thought about it before, as I also hadn't. 
          <br><br>
I also agree with you that micro apartments and communal living sounds nice in theory, but is this realistic? Since pre-teens we have idolized the idea of having a big house with a fenced yard and now as young adults see celebrities with their mansions ten times that size, which only makes us want more and more. I wish everything wasn't so superficial but that is where we are at currently and I desperately hope it changes soon.



<br><hr>
I also shocked by the statistics mentioned in the lecture. How crazy it is that  more than a quarter of our carbon footprint comes from our home! Moreover, I am also skeptical about the possibility to realize the idea of micro-apartment and communal living raised by Pro.Ken in the lecture. It is true that living in a micro-apartment or communal living sounds good to the environment; nevertheless, the contemporary belief hold by the majority is that living in a large house and possessing countless luxuries is the symbol of success, which definitely will hamper the promotion of the former idea. Most people may well find that it is inconvenient to live in a micro-apartment if they are prone to contemporary consumerism rather than the minimalism lifestyle in that the micro-apartment may not big enough to store all the things they bug. In addition, like you mentioned in your comments that the contemporary celebrities such as Kardashians own huge places and hold the goal that living bigger is better, how could we ask the ordinary to live in a small apartment instead of pursing a large and more comfortable house? Thus, the initial step we need to do to realize the idea is to convert our cognition towards success and enhance the responsibilities we need to take in exchange for a better environment. Reducing the emission of greenhouse is impending and is our collaborative responsibilities. Once if we could consider it as our prime goal, it is much easier to promote the idea of living in a small apartment and enjoy the communal living.
          <br><br>

Besides the idea of living in a small apartment and enjoy the communal living, I am totally agree with Ken’s view on living in the city rather than suburb. Cities have large population which means government will enhance its fundamental infrastructures to enhance one’s living standard. Thus, mass transportation in cities are far more convenient comparing to the suburb. Therefore, it is feasible to live in cities without a car as one can take bus or subways to reach everywhere; nonetheless, it is a nightmare to live in a suburb without a car due to the poor transportation systems.

This is not the first time that Ken mentions the important role that the size of the house we live plays in the emission of greenhouse gases. However, I am surprised that living in big cities actually causes less emission than living in a suburban area for a lot of reasons, for example, transportation. Ken also raised the idea about the co-housing community. I think it is a good idea because it not only reduces personal carbon footprint but also brings people together, to have a nearer connection with each other. I am sure there are a lot of people with the same mindset as I, so if city improvements can draw in more and more people, we are succeeding.

For the past 8 weeks in this class, I have been thinking more and more about the role that housing plays when it comes to the climate crisis. It is crazy to think about how 17% of the average American’s carbon footprint comes from heating and cooling the house while another 15% comes from lighting and other housing utilities. This adds up to a whole 32% of our carbon footprint just from housing! To make matters even worse, the average size of a house is 2500 square feet in the United States when it used to be just 1000 square feet! This is all happening while the average family size is getting smaller and smaller. This makes me think about what I can do to help this situation. While it may be hard to convince my parents to move out of the house that they work for, I can still do my part and live in a micro-apartment when I move out.

Personally, I don’t know if I would be able to live in cohousing communities, but I can see myself living in a micro apartment. I like how in this lecture, Hiltner gives us a viable, convenient alternative to decrease our carbon footprint in regards to housing and transportation. I really would not mind living in the city to reduce my transportation and housing emissions. Everything would probably be closer together and walking distance, and I honestly prefer walking/biking over driving. (I hate parking and traffic!) It would also reduce gas, heating/cooling, etc costs. I also think if more people moved to cities, the public transportation would be much better than it is right now. Living in smaller spaces also means less cleaning and space for junk. My home back in the bay really enables my parents and sometimes me to be hoarders. 
          <br><br>
A part of the lecture video that I thought was interesting is the juxtaposition of nature and cities. Books and movies do depict cities as dirty and polluted. In real life, we do tend to view cities as one of the main sources of CO2 emissions when in fact, it’s the opposite. I think it’s really cool that environmentalists are “greening” cities and even suburbs!

Yes. I agree with you. I also like to walk or take buses rather than driving. Micro apartments are also attractive to me, especially is environmentally friendly. To be honest, I am staggered to learn that the average housing size is two and a half larger than the housing size in 1950 even though the family size hasn’t increased. A large part of footprints come from houses. As the professor mentioned that “the Japanese housing size is much smaller” which means that there are fewer CO2 emissions for houses. Also, I have never imagined the footprints of building a house. I only take my attention on transportations and fossil fuels. So, the very nice point is that Professor Ken gives specific suggestions on how we are going to do to reduce our carbon emissions on houses. Living in a city can help to use more bicycles. I also learn that many cities have put in efforts to install micro-apartments like NYC program. Living in a small house can reduce carbon emissions and reduce unnecessary wastes. However, when the professor mentions Coe housing. I doubt the plausibility of sharing meals or common resources with others. It is not easy to share something with others when most of people are individualists now. We are used to use things that belong to ourselves and used not to share living spaces with others. That’s why I prefer micro-apartment rather than Coe Housing.

I have to be honest, I really do not plan on getting a mansion. I mean it is cool and all but I relly think you do not need that much space. Really as long as my family and me can be confrotable and live in a micro appartment or co-housing, I am willing to do it. Also, it will probably be cheaper for me as well. Money would not be a problem if I reach job difficulties in the future. In addition, me and my freinds were actually of thinking of living in a house for a while which still could lower carbon emissions. With more people in the house, it is less of a impact towards carbon emissions for housing. 
          <br><br>


In this lecture, what shocked me the most was Green cities. As Ken said, enviromental activists are thinking towards how to change the cites and towns we have now to have a postive impact towards the enviroment and climate change. People might think cities are bad because it looks like they emit so much carbon emissions. But, in reality, the suburbans and towns are even worse then cities. What people have to know is that living a little apratment in a city can really help the enivroment instead of living in a big house in a town.

I share the same feelings about living in a mansion. There is really no reason that anyone would need a house that big, especially if there are only a handful of people living in it. To me, building a bunch of mansions seems like a waste of space. Why does anyone need all that space? What is the point of having a bunch of rooms that won’t be used the majority of the time? Rather than building one large mansion for a single person or family, we could build a bunch of smaller housing units for multiple people and families to live in. Not only will this address the housing issue currently seen across the United States, it is also beneficial for the environment. 

          <br><br>

Like you've mentioned before, I also like the idea of living in a micro apartment or co-housing. This year, I have been living with 7 of my other friends, 2 per room,  in a single apartment. It doesn’t even feel cramped with the 8 of us in one building. If anything, I find this living situation more enjoyable than getting an apartment or suite to live in by myself. I was a bit unsure of living with this many people but it was one of the best decisions of my life. I enjoyed this experience so much that next year, I will still be sharing an apartment with the same group of friends. I definitely recommend that everyone should try the whole co-housing experience at least once before they form any opinions about it. Because we are all in college right now, this is the perfect time to try it out!

The idea that city living is more environmentally friendly than country living is so interesting to me because when you think about being more “green” your mind doesn’t go to dirty, polluted, consumer-driven cities. When I think of being more “green” my mind goes to nature, and being more connected to the natural aspect of the environment around us. While the latter is very important, as Ken suggested in this video, the greenness and natural aspect can be brought into cities, giving us the best of both worlds. I was in San Francisco over winter break and my family and I visited an elevated park in the middle of the city at the Salesforce Transit Center. It was a really pretty and diverse park, but I felt kind of weird walking through it. It felt unnatural and in a way futuristic, but it made me kind of sad. It was like a preview to what nature is going to look like and feel like in the future with continued urbanization and development. However, after watching this lecture, I feel a little bit better and okay with the creation of things like the elevated park in San Francisco. The fact that living in apartments in cities and using public transit is more sustainable than living in large country homes with the need to commute to town is important to consider. While it is sad that we can’t all live out in the open with nature around us and no tall buildings blocking views, the best we can do to live more sustainably while also enjoying nature, is incorporate these elevated green parks into cities. This will make it so that we can still have that aspect of nature for ourselves, but also give back to our environment and honor it by living small and doing what we can to be more “green”, even if that means living in a city.

The first sentence of Hull’s comment encapsulates my initial reactions to the idea that city living is more environmentally friendly than rural living. I understand that it is not this simple and that the biggest factor in that disparity is that a transition from mostly city living to mostly rural living would be environmentally unreasonable, unrealistic, and catastrophic. Still, it is a tough concept to grasp that city living is what we need to fight the climate crisis. More specifically, what we must do is reconfigure the ways our cities are structured. We must overturn the mentality that cities are environmentally destructive, as well as the practices that go with this mentality. This involves eco-nurturing, a practice that is fundamentally necessary to the reconfiguration that must take place. Activists are already bringing nature to cities. Examples are rooftop gardens, backyard chicken coops, and vertical farming. The practices and structures to fight climate change in cities are in place -- they just have to be embraced by a much greater segment of our population.

There is something about growing up in a small town with a population of 3,500 surrounded by the mountains, rivers, lakes, and the stars that people who live in cities will never be able to experience.
          <br><br>
I grew up in a tiny town called Weaverville, in the very northern part of California. I played in the dirt, climbed trees, made damns in our creek, swam in mountain lakes, slept under the stars as often as possible, and most importantly I developed a deep love for mother nature. Luckily, I had parents that were very into the outdoors, taking me backpacking and river rafting at age three. They told me not to pick the wildflowers so others could enjoy their beauty and told me that I was hurting the earth when I took a short cut on a hike. 
          <br><br>
I think about my childhood often. It is part of me that I would never give up in a million year, it made me the person I am today, and its instilled a passion in me to do anything possible to help/save our beautiful mother. So when Ken mentioned that a way to cut down on our foot print was to move to cities I don’t know if I can fully get behind the idea. If I have a family, I want to raise them playing in the dirt so that have that connection with the earth and want to protect it. I think that there are ways to accomplish both living in a rural area and to cut down on one’s carbon footprint. When I imagine my future, I imagine me living in a tiny home with solar panels on the roof, with a huge garden where I produce most of the food I eat. I live close enough to the town to be able to bike everywhere. I think there are ways that rural living can be sustainable.
          <br><br>
However, at the same time I hear what Ken is saying and I am drawn in by the idea of living in co-housing where living in shifted from individualist to a more open living. As an extrovert this would be a great way to spend time with interesting people and make great connections. I also really liked the idea of invading cites with nature and bringing that into the culture. I think these are all very important especially for people living in suburbs. I agree that we should get more people living in the cities, however I am worried that if everyone were to move to cities we would lose a deep part of our population that has a connection with nature in such a deep manner.

I also grew up in a rural area and that afforded me many similar opportunities. I also share this longing to return to it. I think the damaging aspect of our past movements away from the city was that we still held onto the modernity of city living. I believe there are ways to live sustainably outside of the city. I think it all depends on consumption and transportation habits. Cities necessitate close living and smaller housing which is a necessary shift environmentally for how we currently use energy. I found the part about our individualistic tendencies to be interesting. I think focusing on sharing things, including housing, will help us environmentally but also emotionally. Our entire lives, media has told us that consumption will make us happy. I look forward to the necessary cultural shift that exposes the true sources of happiness which include community. Since more than half of the world's population lives in cities, it is important to rethink our image of them and to accurately understand them as places where people can live sustainably.

<br><hr>
I really appreciated that you said you were looking forward to the necessary cultural shift that would expose the true sources of happiness. I think that this is a really important thing to think about when discussing the issue of climate change and how we adjust the way that we live. Instead of thinking about all the "bad" affects that come with reducing house size and moving from suburbs to cities we need to reframe that thinking to think more about the benefits. These benefits include things such as a strong community, less time being spent commuting, working together with similar minded people. 
          <br><br>
I also think that living in rural areas can be possible by just thinking more about how to make it more environmentally friendly, like I said if we were to reduce the square footage of our houses and increase the size of our gardens so that we could produce most of the food that we eat. There are ways to reframe thinking and lifestyles so that we can be the happiest versions of ourselves.

I am the first person to criticize people who have guest rooms and who live well beyond their means, however, I also grew up in a five-bedroom 3-bathroom house. Every room was occupied, we had no "guest rooms" but we also probably didn't need that much space. I think about how my grandfather lived in a trailer, willingly, for years before my mom and aunt convinced him that he needed to move into a 2-bedroom house occupied by just himself. He didn't need that much space, nor did he want it, but we live in a society that convinces you that you need it. This is more of a cultural problem more than anything where we as a society have convinced each other that the way to display our wealth is to inhabit the largest home possible. We have made this the standard living arrangement. We are moving away from a more inclusive society where we can co-inhabit places and where we can all have a roof over our heads. We are moving towards a sink or swim mentality where if you can't afford a place to live then you don't deserve one. I'm not sure the solution to this, and I personally am not sure how I feel about big cities and apartments, that was never what I had envisioned for myself growing up, but maybe it's time to start taking a look at a more environmentally friendly future for myself. Micro apartments were never something I had ever even though about, but they too have their own benefits and having neighbors and people who live so close to you could actually be fun. Much like the dorms, I guess.



</p><hr>


<p>

There is a cutural problem when it comes to living arrangements. Americans want to live in big homes as evident with the supersizing of houses from 1950 to today. There is a rhetoric that bigger is better and that if one can afford a large home then why not have one. Individual success in America is seen through one's posssessions so of course people want big homes, nice cars, and luxury items. This has been the case for many centuries but it is certainly an unfortunate one for thirty two percent of an individual's climate footprint comes from their homes.
          <br><br>
What has to be done to minimize the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is to move to microapartments or cohousing in cities. This is not some futuristic idea, rather it is already being adopted in cities like New York, Boston, and San Fransisco. Cities are the way to go, a more natural “green metropolis” is possible. In this city movement, nature is brought into cities through rooftop gardens and such. We need to rethink the image of cities and stop moving to rural locals because in the process we are destroying nature and the enviornment on a global scale. In regards to housing, I would voluntarily live in cohousing because I think it would be nice to live in a tight community. I would share hously duties with other adults and my children would have other kids to play with; children whose parents I would know and trust. I think comunity is importamt for oneself and for the upbringing of children.

You are definitely correct in the fact that since the 50s, there has been a huge influx of people who wish to switch to bigger homes, which reflects the status within our society. When we choose the house that we want to live in, the car that we want to drive, the clothes that we want to wear, and the food that we want to eat, we always look to see not just what benefits us the most and what option offers the most practical solution. Instead, we look to what other people will think about our decisions and how we can promote the “best way of living” to others, as if what other people have (that you may not even know at that) is important. We see all of the sports cars and steak dinners and mansions with pools and a tennis court and we create a culture that drives us to want these things because the top 1 percent of America or the world has these things. 
          <br><br>


But why do we think like this? Why do we have this insane comparison of other people, and in the process, not only make ourselves feel bad, but make the rest of the Earth suffer. Like Ken said, this is a cultural issue, and people believe that they cannot live in a smaller home for a variety of reasons, but the core excuse for not wanting to move out of the big house or stopping to use all of these “boujee” items is because we feel as if they are not good enough. However, we never just look at what we actually need; what is practical to us. In “Walden”, we see that there really is no need for such a fancy and extravagant lifestyle. Why have this? And in doing so, we are doing our part in destroying our climate. So, what is the point of just buying bigger and better if you’ll never have the most, and in this process, we are destroying the climate?

          <br><br>

Our society needs a restructuring, especially what it means to be sustainable. We think that the future is a new wave of “sustainable” industrialization, but we need to reflect on what those things mean. How can we do that if we are continuously destroying the planet? We need to make sure that we are rethinking what our future looks like, and that will always determine what our housing looks like in the future.


<br><hr>
I definitely have to agree that there is a big cultural issue when it comes to housing. A while back I remember I would always tell my parents that I wanted to live in a van or a tiny home. While this was mainly a joke at the time, it highlighted to me how we look at housing. My parents were like "neither of those are real homes" or something along those lines. While yes, I can agree that living in a van for my life probably isn't the most plausible thing, I still began to think about it. I just found it funny how a method of living is so looked down upon, despite the fact that it essentially forces someone to be minimalist, it opens up the opportunity to run solely off renewables (except gas of course), and satisfies to desire to travel without air travel. While this obviously isn't the solution for the majority of the world, it could work. I just find it funny how anything below the standard two-story suburb home is looked down as poorer, despite the fact that it could lead to a much richer and climate-friendly lifestyle.
          <br><br>

Sadly, I also think city-living is looked at a certain way. I feel that most people look at city life as a "hustle-bustle" lifestyle. They don't see it as a permanent place to live. In order to be 'successful', you need to be able to settle down in the typical suburb home. Hopefully this cultural outlook will eventually change, at least to open up options such as co-housing or similar options.

The comparison between the size of an average american house and a traditional japanese house really stuck with me. Growing up me and my siblings were always sharing rooms and lived in smaller houses. While that was due to our financial situation rather than our environmental activism, I am so grateful for that time with my siblings. We always had so much fun staying up late or even just playing outside that if I have kids I think I would want to live in a smaller house just so that they can have similar cool experiences. Also just thinking about what was important to me growing up, the mountains and lakes and nature around me was literally the center of my childhood. Imagining that the next couple generations might not be able to experience nature the way I did is tragic. I do not see living in a small house as inferior to a big house (side note if you watch tiny houses on netflix you can see how insanely cool they can be) I just see it as its own different lifestyle with so many different perks. I hope that a simplistic lifestyle keeps being trendy because I honestly believe that it is so much better not only for the environment but for mental and emotional health.

Hearing Ken talk about the possible future of living was pretty reassuring to me because I hope to one day live in a smaller house. When I was younger though, I had always dreamed about having my own big mansion but now as I’ve grown up and matured I’ve realized I only need the bare minimum to live a happy life. I think as a child most people think bigger is better but as people begin to mature people begin to realize that materialistic things don’t bring you a constant source of happiness and the only thing that can is experiences and the company of other people. By creating communities of mass sustainability as our society begins to shift away from the bigger is better mentality, we as a united nation can go a long way to better our planet. One way I’ve seen our society shift towards sustainability was through metal drinking straws. For the longest time, there was a big push to ban plastic straws since they hurt animals in our oceans and leave our planet filled with hard to degrade waste. Soon, metal drinking straws became a new trend, and this was one of the first trends I had seen that had blown up so big in such a small amount of time that wasn’t hurting our planet like fast fashion was. I believe we can make smaller housing a trend like that as once it gains win how affordable and healthy for our planet smaller living or minimalism is, it will take off a people will be dying to try out the new lifestyle. In the end, it comes down to the trends and if people would follow them.

I agree with a lot of the points that you made throughout your comment. When I was younger I also wanted to have a large house, and the nicest car. However, after taking this course my dreams have changed to having a smaller house that is more affordable to not only me but the planet. I have learned that more doesn't always mean better, and it definitely does not mean that it makes you happier. A lot of people switch over to vegan diets and metal straws as they see those things becoming trends. If we were to use social media and commercials to have more people switch over to more a more environmentally friendly lifestyle we would be using media for a good cause instead of what it does now, which is that it encourages consumerism.

I strongly feel that our society has become lost in the desperate desires of material wealth and comfortability. Everything has become centered on convenience and luxury, the bigger the better or the more technologically updated the better. This has caused this image of the most luxurious lifestyle to be the normative desire of achievement and standard in to having "made it in live". As a result, everyone is looking and setting goals to attain this scale of wealth and success, ignorant to the environmental degradation these decisions would have. Hearing Ken speak about the need to scale down our self-defined model of "comfortable living" and realize the excess it truly is. I agree with this view that there is no need for the large investment in homes because I feel as though our society has wrongly justified any home improvements as a necessity due to the fact that everyone needs somewhere to live. The need for a roof over your head is in fact one of the basic necessities of life, but the extent to where we shower ourselves in larger square footage and filling our homes with the nicest technologies goes beyond what we truly need.I feel that the idea of micro apartments and cohousing communities are a wonderful idea, but this change will be met with resistance because of our current distorted view that we are returning to a "primitive" style of living during a time where technology and advancements are flourishing. We need to redefine what we truly need and don't in order to mitigate the climate crisis.

Transportation, housing, and stuff seem like necessities. We don't want to be homeless. We like travel. We over consume stuff. The answer to these habitual behaviors is that we can move into micro apartments, bike, and shop at thrift stores. I remember when I was young I would watch the Disney channel and there were short stories about people around the world that did extraordinary things. One young man was featured for climbing all of the worlds largest mountains. Another girl was featured for creating all of her own clothes out of clothes she already had. She was creative and always had a great fashion sense. I feel like we should venture to be more creative not only in changing our consumption habits but in every aspect of our lives. We are so used to the way we live and that way of living is toxic to our environment. However, if we try to be creative we can actually have fun changing our habits into sustainable behaviors. It takes people with innovative thinking to solve the climate crisis.

   If everyone lived the way college students did I doubt that housing would be an environmental issue. I don't think me and my 8 other house mates have turned on the heater in our house once! Thanks to Santa Barbara's weather we don't use the air conditioner either. In Isla Vista houses and apartments are packed with kids because the cost of living is so high. Is that the atmosphere we need to create for other adults? Do you think if the cost of living went up everywhere that people would choose to participate in cohabitation more often? We have already begun to initiate a society of sharing resources like how we share strangers homes and cars through AirBnB and Uber. Should their be an app to locate shared community gardens or other resources that we are capable of working together to distribute? I feel like the world as we know it is going to change very soon. Once we realize that our behaviors are unsustainable everyone is going to have to work together to create a reality where our planet can survive with us on it.

I did not realize how much emissions a house produces. Sure the reading two weeks ago mentioned how most of our emissions come from refrigerators that produce chemicals that significantly warm the world. I believe it has always made sense that city living was good for the environment. I believe they emit a lot of greenhouse gases, but that is only because there is a large concentration of people in the cities. Like Ken has repeated, cities are so condense that people have to live in smaller places and can commute easier to their destinations. Cities also have more forms or transportation that are greener, like a bus, train, or even walking. All of these things that are a part of city living help to cut down emissions and city living is becoming way more popular. This is way greener than suburb living. I live in a pretty suburban city and I never thought about how it affects the environment. The big houses with multiple fridges and cars and the amount of driving people have to do to get to school and the greater amount of driving people do to get to work in LA is a lot. It is basically giving a little amount of people a big amount of land and all the resources  without any limit which is not environmentally friendly.  I feel like this is directly related to social habits. Like Ken said early in the year, it is up to us to be more environmentally friendly by not having a big house and be mindful of how we transport ourselves and how much we waste. We must each individually make great strides in changing our social habits if we want to make significant change to save our planet.

I agree with you. As you said, the reason why city living was good for the environment is not only the housing but also the transportation and other aspects of city living style. It is true that the city is maximizing the utility of land. And, public transportation is much more environmental-friendly than driving a private car.  Many people might think about why not all people start to live in the city for environmental goodness. This is because city living will sacrifice a private and peaceful lifestyle. It is also true that some people can't endure the noisy and fast pace lifestyle in the city. Actually, it is individual's right to decide where to live. Therefore, living in the city can be an option to contribute personal effort to the climate issue. 
            <br><br>
Personally speaking, I prefer the city to live more, since there are many shops with different functions, which can make our daily life convenient. And, I believe that living in the city is the main trend in society. As the population increase, people must get used to maximize the utility of land.  Overall, try to begin helping the climate issue with living in the city if you can get used to it.

Though extremely necessary, I believe that the shift from living in suburban areas back to cities and urban areas will be very difficult and honestly unlikely for older generations to do without someone "making them" do it. This is because for centuries, the idea of achieving the "American Dream" has been perpetuated down through generations, leading to one believing that success means a being able to provide for one's family not just life's necessities, but a big house filled with all the "stuff" anyone could ever want. For this reason, I feel that the shift from suburban life back to urban  life is one that will only truly happen with the younger and future generations, as we have the power to redefine not only the "American Dream", but also what measures success. I feel that another great example of moving away from McMansions and into more sustainable housing is the tiny house movement. Though a home under 400 sq. feet is considered a "tiny house", many of  these homes are far smaller with some as small as 80 square feet, and are not only financially prudent, but are also far more sustainable and safer from an economic standpoint as well. Furthermore, many tiny houses are built to last as long as traditional homes, and are aesthetically similar to larger homes. I feel like more and more often I see videos and articles of people whose lives are completely changed for the better after moving into a tiny house. There are also now TV series such as "Tiny House Hunters" and "Tiny House Nation" which focus solely on people trying to find their dream tiny home. To me, these people are the living proof that the number of bathrooms one has is not equivalent to their success or happiness. If we continue to normalize tiny houses as well as micro-apartments and co-housing units, hopefully the era of the mcmansion in which we are currently living in will be a thing of the past.

I also find that the concept of living in the city to be really interesting. However, I feel like it is also unfeasible as this is more of a cultural problem about the way people view success than an easy fix of our lifestyle. I found it interesting that in order to be more environmentally cautious, we should move to the city. The city has always been associated with pollution, taxis, and a lot of smog in my mind. But, after this lecture video, I've actually realized that the close-knit layout of the city is the best thing that can happen for the environment. People can utilize public transport everyday or walk. I appreciate that the media is making the concept of tiny houses and smarter living more and more mainstream. I think this is the best way to make the shift easier. Many people have the mentality to follow trends, so once the idea of living in tiny houses picks up, many people will find it "trendy" to do so. Although they may not be moving into these houses for the sole intention of minimizing carbon footprint, they are still moving nonetheless.

You mentioned that the shift from living in a suburban area back to an urban city life would be hard to do and hard for people to accept. I think this is generally true. In our past history, cities developed slowly, with migration to cities happening over decades as people realized that greater wealth was generated from urban areas in comparison to lives of farming. It took years and years for most of the people to transition to urban life. Now, people are instead, in search of suburban life as a rejection to urban life, in hopes of escaping the high crime, noise, crowdedness, dirty image of cities. Not only is this image advertised, it is plastered in many of our minds as the image of cities. To ask people to transition back to cities, in such a short allotted time frame that is needed for climate change, I think, is not ideal. Most of the older generations do not want to remain in cities and would choose to live a suburban life. However, I do agree with you that the transition to cities can be made by younger and working generations. They would seek work and opportunities in cities. 
            <br><br>
Your mention of the tiny house also interested me. I have heard of them before, but since taking this class, I have heard about it more frequently. I liked that you mentioned how the size of the house does not correlate with success. I believe that this is true. If one is living in the house they are happiest and most comfortable in, then I think that is the definition of success. Success should no longer be defined as owning the most or the biggest. I think that this thinking is definitely needed for environmental activism.

I definitely have noticed that houses are slowing supersizing. Over my lifetime, I have moved three times, each time the house was bigger than the last. In today’s culture, it seems like the size of your home measures how successful you are. It is the norm to see homes with huge flat screen TV’s, open floor plan, walk-closets, and pool in the backyard. I’m not surprised that 32% of our climate footprint comes from our homes. It is engraved in the American mind that we should strive for bigger thinking it will make our lives better. And of course, with every newer and bigger home, Americans feel the need to fill it up with more stuff. This is a never-ending cycle.

I think the idea of creating micro apartments in large cities would be a good idea. However, I think it would be difficult to convince people to move from a 2500 square foot home to a 300 square foot home. There is still an appeal to live in rural and suburban areas because of safety, noise, and comfort. The idea of bringing country and city together by creating a green metropolis could be attractive for many people. This idea is more environmentally friendly and blends the best of both worlds.

For me, the biggest plus side of living in a city is the proximity to thigs like the grocery store, restaurants, work, school, parks, etc. I even like the idea of living with or close to friends and family. My ideal future would be that my family and closest friends all live in my neighborhood. Unfortunately, even though I want all this, I still think I would run into some trouble living in micro apartments. Personal space is one; everyone needs time alone, and from my experience having roommates living in Isla vista, it can be very hard to find time for oneself. 
            <br><br>

Houses are getting too big. Having a big home has become a status symbol. I do think many houses are too large, but I also think there can be a happy medium between a mansion and a micro apartment. I’m sure many people would agree with me and want their own places, but the fact of the matter is it’s just not practical. And with this new world that humans have created, we won’t always be able to have our ideal situations. So even though I want to be a home-owner, I know that I will likely live in an apartment for the rest of my life. I can live with that, and I know most people in this class can live with that, but I hope the majority of Americans can too. That’s how I feel about most of the solutions to the climate crisis: the people who really care will settle for anything short of an apocalypse, but so many others would rather see the heat death of the planet than give up their Big Mac.


<br><hr>
I also think there’s already a lot of resistance for many to the idea of living in a city. Not only do suburban communities provide a greater feeling of comfort and safety, as you mentioned, but they’re also substantially less expensive. For many, I think the cost is a big part of the reason why so many people live in suburban communities that are 30 minutes outside the city. They’d much rather spend time commuting than pay the difference in rent to live in a smaller house. Not only that, but many cities are already overcrowded and busy with 55% of the human population already living in cities. Although, I’m not saying that there’s no appeal to living in a city. It’s definitely a benefit that most things are walking distance in a city, negating the need for a car. Cities also tend to have much more activity which is attractive to a more active audience. I personally would love to live in a city if it was something I could afford. I feel like the push for people to live in cities rather than suburbias will only be effective if the price of city living is reduced. Perhaps, there could be a program similar to Adapt NYC that has real estate developers compete to make sustainable but relatively cheap housing communities in cities. Something like this would surely tempt more people to move to cities. 
            <br><br>
In regard to the importance of our housing choices, I do think that a change in this department is vital in fighting the climate crisis. The fact that 32% of the average American’s carbon footprint comes from our homes shows how much potential for carbon reduction there is if we adopt more sustainable living situations. I found the Green City Movement that Ken mentioned fascinating. This movement enables people to bring more nature to the cities so that they’re not only surrounded by the cold, industrial look of high-rise buildings. This could help persuade the portion of people living in suburbias that are there because they want that mix of nature and city. Fostering more greenery in cities could also help to improve the community feel if things like community gardens or compost lots were put in.

After watching the lecture video for this week, I had learned a great deal more about housing and its potential negative impacts on the environment and the styles of housing as a form of environmental activism. It had never occurred to me that even our housing options and styles can be a part of environmental activism since the environment and housing seem like two completely irrelevant areas. However, just as Ken brought up in the video, constructing a house can release as much as 80 metric tons which is utterly crazy to me at a first glance but seems pretty reasonable after thinking through the large amounts of materials needed for construction and the labor involved with building a typical house. Also, I was surprised to see that living in the cities can actually be more environmentally-friendly and beneficial to reducing our personal carbon footprint because I was also used to think that city life would be considered as environmental disasters and catastrophes rather than beneficial as cities tend to have heavier pollution in the atmosphere and in the water, more cars,  louder noise, and a less pleasant lifestyle in general compared to that in the suburbs. The suburb lifestyle is also one of the central values in the American culture that it is so ingrained into our society and culture that having a big house in the quiet suburban area is a necessary requirement for the achievement of the American Dream. But is it true that a suburban lifestyle would be really that much better than the urban city life? I would say yes prior to taking this course as bigger houses in the suburb just sounds so much more green and environmentally-friendly than the crammed compacted life and construction in the cities. After taking this course and watching Ken's lecture video, I realized the other side to the comfortable typically American life in the suburbs that living in the suburbs can be quiet destructive and harmful environmentally resulting from a larger carbon footprint per person with the larger houses occupying more unnecessary landmass and using an excessive amount of energy and resources. Transportation is another major contributor to the larger suburb carbon footprint because people have to commute with cars and cars of course release a ton of carbon dioxide. 
            <br><br>


In regards to Ken's question on cohousing communities, I was pretty interested in it and was curious about it because I had never lived in a cohousing community before as I grew up with my family members only and I was pretty much used to growing up that way, but I don't think it would hurt to share the various housing facilities and pieces of equipment in one house with a couple of other families since one family cannot use all of the equipment and facilities all the time anyways. Additionally, cohousing provides a perfect opportunity to connect and bond people together in a community because they will inevitably grow closer and more connected to each other as they share the resources and equipment of the same house, and this may be the reason behind people's positive experience of cohousing in Denmark as mentioned by Ken because people live together in a family-like communities and therefore feel less alone or disconnected when they live separately from each other in a house of their own. In terms of micro-apartments, I am planning to live in one of those in the future when I start working because I want to move to New York and New York has a lot of really nice options for small and micro-apartments for people to rent and buy. Micro-apartments are literally the perfect housing option along with cohousing communities because these small apartments are very efficient with their spaces and utilize all parts of their spaces, and we as residents can live well in those micro-apartments maybe even better than living in a big lavish house in the suburb while significantly reducing our carbon footprint through living in the micro-apartments that save energy and resource use. It is a perfect idea that kills two birds with one stone.

I completely agree. I would never have thought that a persons housing could account for almost one third of their emissions. I believe this is because I don't correlate housing with being bad for the environment, as I do fossil fuels. This should be alerted to more people. I think people now are understanding that meat is bad for the environment, but in reality, housing is a bigger problem. The idea that "bigger is better" is really hurting the environment and the world. I am glad that there are kinds of housing that are seen as environmentalism. I think that we should adjust our daily lives with the good of the environment in mind. 
            <br><br>

It is very true that it has been engrained in our culture to want to live in a huge house in a quiet suburban neighborhood. I think that this might finally be making a switch, as Ken explained that there has been a great migration to the cities recently. Also, I would like to hear about co-housing from someone who lives in it. I would like to hear their first hand experience and why they chose it. Implementing the housing changes of moving to a micro-apartment or co-housing community would greatly reduce our carbon footprint, while bettering our overall well-being. Ken makes the advantages of this switch plain and simple. If we reduce our lavish lifestyle, we will reduce our carbon footprint. It is as simple as that. 
            <br><br>

Housing may be a large change for some people, if they are moving from a "mcmansion," as Ken says, to a micro-apartment. However, people should not be scared or deterred away from this change, because of all of the benefits that come with it. It saves energy, resources, money, space, and many more things, along with being better for the environment. I hope that the micro-housing communities continue to grow and gain popularity. I think that for more people to move to them, they need to be more normalized, or mainstream. This is possible, though. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the different kinds of environmentally friendly housing and cities.

I grew up in a fairly small town (around 6000 people, mostly retired individuals) and I always loved how beautiful and green my town was. It is on the beach so you can frequently smell the ocean, in spring everything is green and colorful, and at night the sky is so clear you can see the milky way (I used to walk home from work at night and it was one of my favorite parts of those evenings). My only hesitation with living somewhere like my town when I got older was the fact that it was isolated and small (not a lot of job opportunities and the town being small and beautiful made living expensive). When I moved to Santa Barbara I loved it but I still saw changes in the environment that made me miss the nature of my town and I decided I would never want to live in a large city, cramped in small housing and stuck in smog from city travel. However, watching these past lectures has made me think that perhaps city living would not be so bad, especially if we start moving toward greener cities, planting in unused space and on the tops of buildings. A city with gardens on all of the buildings could be beautiful to see and live in. In addition, I had not previously considered how living in a rural town would affect the environment, that by moving into a smaller place in a city I could help preserve the environment and thus places like my town. I truly hope that green cities will be implemented in the future and I am excited to see what environmental changes we can accomplish with time.

I grew up surrounded by palm trees and the occasional grass patch; I grew up in the city. When I came to Santa Barbara, the air seemed crisp and I could see the stars, it was amazing. It's crazy to learn that cities, however, contribute less to carbon emissions but it makes sense. With such a dense amount of people trying to fit into one area, I've witnessed houses being destroyed for new apartments. I've witnessed neighborhoods transform from houses to condos and duplexes, and I used to not like it. But after taking this class, I have a greater appreciation for them. Being in the city, with so many people everywhere, it gets tiring. Traffic is terrible, there are so many things happening at once, and it just gets old. I was so curious as to how my life would have been had I grew up in the suburbs. I grew up in a house and knew that I wanted to live in one when I could afford my own place, but my perspective has changed completely. I think alleviating the climate crisis has become the first thing on my priorities and if living in small apartments is the way, I'm all for it. Watching this video, it's crazy to think that I may not even have that choice. The climate crisis is getting worse at an exponential rate, which means drastic changes will need to be made in a short amount of time. Had Thoreau tried to attempt his minimalistic lifestyle, he would need to do a lot more to help the climate crisis. It's interesting that when we were first assigned Thoreau's reading, I never considered that this may become the way of life. And it's not a bad thing, but its need on our planet is not a great one.

I agree with your comment “When I came to Santa Barbara, the air seemed crisp and I could see the stars, it was amazing.” I, like many others, chose UCSB for its academics, resources and its beaches. I love being in open spaces and appreciating nature. In fact, my childhood dream was to save enough money to buy a house in the middle of nowhere in Northern California. This is why it was shocking to me to hear that living this way would increase my carbon footprint more than if I lived in a city. After learning that 86% of our carbon footprint comes from our homes, cars and consumption of stuff I have done some serious reconsidering. I am not opposed to living in a relatively “small space” (What is small?) since for the foreseeable future I plan to live alone. I think it would save me money and energy having to clean a larger space. I like being able to walk short distances or take public transportation. Having grown up in a small city in between LA and San Diego I loved the summer trips my family would take to the major hubs. It might take more time for me to get used to the idea of a micro-apartment however, I think we are at the point that if we were to make true change in the climate crisis we have to make drastic changes in our lifestyle now.

I think co-housing and micro apartments are two creative ways to cut down our home-induced CO2 emissions. I definitely think co-housing sounds more effective than micro apartments, however not necessarily more favorable. Co-housing would allow less appliances such as refrigerators amongst families. Instead of four families in separate houses with four refrigerators, in a co-housing community, they could share one kitchen and one refrigerator. Whereas micro apartments still appropriate the energy using appliances evenly to each person. However, I think if I were given the choice to live in a micro apartment or co-housing, I would choose a micro apartment. I currently live in what I would say a hybrid of a micro-apartment. Four girls in rooms that only fit a desk and bed and little walking space, a shared small living space with a couch, and a shared kitchen with a refrigerator, oven, and stove. We cook meals together once a week and sometimes with other units mimicking the lifestyle of co-housing. We also have a very small sq ft per person. My room is around 9" by 11" plus the shared space of kitchen and living room probably equates to the amount that Thoreau lived in. If I had the choice though, I think a micro-apartment is more comfortable because you still have the privacy of a normal home, but live in a smaller, simpler manner. Co-housing seems scary for us Americans as the saying goes "stranger danger." However, if culture is changed to be friendly to strangers and bring them in as a second family, we could definitely have a future in co-housing as the Europeans do.

Growing up, I didn’t know what to expect in terms of how housing worked in college, and although I only have experience here at UCSB, I’m sure there are some similarities across counties and states. It is different for me to see over ten people living together in the same house since I grew up living with just my immediate family (five people total). The same somewhat goes for sorority and fraternity house, but those facilities are so much larger and use more energy, etc. The houses that really impress me are the ones that hold fifteen people and they share two fridges and a few bathrooms. A step up from these are the co-operative houses in which it is more of a community where there is shared responsibilities, chores, and other agreed upon rules to make the co-housing experience as enjoyable as possible. There are obviously positives and negatives associated with large co-housing arrangements, and it depends largely on the type of person one is. For instance, I need more personal space and alone time, so the idea of living with 19 other people (especially people I haven’t necessarily chosen to live with or are great friends with) is terrifying. 
            <br><br>


That being said, I can definitely see myself living in a small or micro apartment after college and for some time coming, until I make other big life changes. I don’t particularly desire a lot of indoor space, just the essentials: bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, and a small lounge area. Honestly I think I would prefer more outdoor space for myself/housemates because I need fresh air and greenery for revitalization. Unfortunately, this may be impossible if living in a densely packed city or large apartment building. A while back I watched a video about small, single occupant apartment buildings that laid out the living space in a way that maximized efficiency. Some of the kitchenware/appliances were hidden and folded in the wall, and the bed area was above the floor to give it a faux two-story vibe. These places are great for students or young adults who don’t plan on being in their living quarters for too much of the day, and who are comfortable living with the bare minimum amount of space. I think this housing style will continue to be popular with young people for years to come, especially as cities grow.

Honestly, moving to UCSB, I had no idea how housing worked either. When Ken was talking about co-housing and how communities would share meals and cook together in a communal kitchen, I automatically thought of the campus dorms. Literally, 2-3 people live in such a small space, the whole floor shares a kitchen and bathrooms. It's the epitope of co-housing. The same goes for the housing on and off-campus too. Manzi and Santa Ynez work the same as well and I used to be so angry at UCSB for making the space so small but now I realized it sorta benefitted us in the long run. Moving to Isla Vista, the houses and apartments are not that different either. 
            <br><br>


Apartments, rooms are still small... everyone still shares a kitchen and if you live in a house, there are more people thus even smaller space. Everyone always says that the housing in IV sucks and I 100% agree but I guess there's some good to it being so small. I will say that because of its size, there is a rent problem in IV. Rent is way too high for the amount of space we live in but that's not the focus here. I do agree with Ken when he encourages people to move to cities because I feel that it is more effective. You can walk to places, and even walking is a better route to places than taking a vehicle - like in New York or San Francisco. I do think it is possible. And even if you do not want to live in a city, many people have invested in tiny homes where their furniture doubles as two things. I've seen videos where someone's bed also doubled as a bookshelf when not used or a dining table. 
            <br><br>


Co-housing and living in a small space is definitely doable, now it's just up to the will to do it. You can promote things all you want but at the end of the day, it whether people think it's worth it or not.


<br><hr>
As someone who lives in a small duplex with seven other housemates, it is definitely doable. While in college it is seen as normal to live with a bunch of friends, living with a bunch of friends when you're settled is not seen as a norm. However, I believe we can definitely change that to reduce our CO2 emissions. Personally for me, I do need personal space, but giving up personal space is something I can work on and get used to. 

            <br><br>

For families who buy unnecessarily huge houses with too much space and too little people, I don't understand why you'd need that much space. Instead, you could be saving that money and use it on something else.

In Ken's lecture video he discusses how Americans are so obsessed with having the biggest house and nicest cars but how we should really be worried about the fate of the planet we live on and downsize our lives. He then offers some alternatives on how to do so. He references options of how the US and other countries have successfully implemented infrastructures to limit their overall carbon emissions. These included moving to larger cities to limit house size and car usage and co-housing which is a shared living community where housing and appliances are shared. 
            <br><br>
Ken mentions that the average American citizen expends 2.5 times their yearly calculated average CO2 emission levels just by living in the average sized American home and using their utilities. 
            <br><br>
That is an absurd amount of carbon dioxide and makes up such a small portion of our lives. That is not even including the things we use outside of our houses, such as cars, daily. This statistic is all the more reason to take the action we can as individuals to lower our emissions such as riding your bike, taking public transportation, and sharing a house. Overall, we all just need to be more conscious of the resources you take advantage of everyday and caring less about the size and price of materialistic things that are entirely unnecessary.

Ken’s lecture hit home for me. I come from an extremely rural town in which the closest Walmart is 30 miles away. Many people I grew up with loved the idea of living in the mountains or far away from others. Which sometimes, sounds like an amazing idea, until you realize the amount of money you're spending in gas. Growing up, there was no public transportation within probably a 200 mile radius of me, therefore, you had to either drive or walk. No one was obviously going to walk 30 miles to get their groceries and clothing, so we all drove. We would buy the food for about a whole month of meals, which also leads to a lot of food waste. Overall, it was very destructive to the environment along with our wallets. Living in a city might seem crazy to someone who wants a large home with a three car garage. It is crazy to think that our houses are 10x bigger than those in Japan and that our families are smaller. It really shows how we were raised on the American Dream and how detrimental this was to our beliefs. We think we need a large backyard and a nice long driveway, but we don't think about how much living space this is taking up. I have always wanted to live in a studio apartment, which is obviously not as sustainable as a micro-apartment, but it still gives me a little space. In reality, no one wants to clean an eight bedroom house and pay for the heating. I personally don’t think I would enjoy living in cohousing, but I think its a great idea for those who wouldn’t mind it. I find it almost humorous to compare Walden's lifestyle to those in a city. If Walden lived in a city, he probably would have cut his carbon footprint down a lot. Yes, he was doing great at the minimalist lifestyle, but he still drove to the city for his other needs. This is why living in a city is better and more sustainable. Now cities are evolving and having urbanized farming along with more mass transportation. City living might be loud and scary, but at the same time, it would be nice to have a grocery store a block away from you.

I agree with you. Growing up in a city, I never really thought about how efficient in energy consumption as well as to our everyday lives is it living in urban areas. Most of the time, we just complain about the air pollution, the lack of vegetation, and traffic jams.
            <br><br>

However, if we really think about it, pollution caused by humans is more prominent in cities than rural areas because the problem is enlarged by the compounded population. If none of us change our lifestyle, moving to the suburbs doesn’t fundamentally change anything. Yes, the air is clearer and we see less cars, but that’s only because we ran away from our coworkers that manufactured this pollution. 
            <br><br>

The sharing system in cities is already ubiquitous in our everyday lives. In Shanghai, the  prosperity in the catering industry is making our daily lives more energy efficient. If calculated one’s time investment into cooking, dining in restaurants are as cheap as making your own food at home. That sounds incredible, but it is achieved with the huge flow of customers and the specialized division of labor.

I lived in Japan and Taiwan my whole life before coming to America for college, and I was surprised that most people want to live in the suburbs away from the city, and would drive for a long time to get to work/school. In Japan and Taiwan, people wanted to live in the center of the cities, no matter how small the apartment is. Location and convenience was everything, and people could walk or take the bus to school/work. I guess it’s the nature of having a big population living in a small space, but I enjoyed how everything was close together. The only people who favored living in the mountains were people who wanted a huge house, who were basically nonexistent. 
            <br><br>
I wish people would realize that living in a compact home in the city has great benefits, and perhaps it outweighs the benefits of living in a big home in the suburbs. Yet, there’s also the question of rent and how it prevents people from being able to live in the city. The people who can do so should definitely consider moving to a small apartment. Living in the city will also grant you access to cheap public transportation.

I think it's interesting that a major part of American culture is the idea of moving out of the house you grew up in once you turn 18 and it's somehow a shameful thing if you are in your 20s and still living with your parents. However, being part of a South Asian family, the idea of multiple families living in one house was normalized to me at a young age. Being raised in the US, I could never experience it myself but I learned about it when I first went abroad to visit my extended family at the age of five, and I saw that my aunts and uncles still lived with their parents - even after marriage. It may seem impractical or like a lot of work to us but I have cousins abroad who live in a two-story house consisting of 12 people, and it is completely manageable and not very different when compared to how we live in the US.
            <br><br>
I recently came across an article “The Nuclear Family Was a Mistake” by David Brooks published in The Atlantic, which presented a very good argument, stating “we’ve made life freer for individuals and more unstable for families. We’ve made life better for adults but worse for children. We’ve moved from big, interconnected, and extended families, which helped protect the most vulnerable people in society from the shocks of life, to smaller, detached nuclear families (a married couple and their children), which give the most privileged people in society room to maximize their talents and expand their opinions”. I think in addition to Ken’s suggestions of living in smaller homes, or living closer to cities we should also normalize the joint-family system.

This is an interesting way of taking charge of how much impact you have on your surroundings with the amount of space you take up. In NYC they have been making a lot of green spaces. Near my house, the city was supposed to allocate the entire waterfront to become a park. Yet real estate companies quickly took issue, and won. Barely any of the waterfront has been developed into an actual park. This shows that there are more interests involved, and even when the entire city population throws their support behind a decision, so many things happen behind closed doors that we have no idea about until suddenly they're building another 50 story building and blocking everyone's view. I think that if the size of your house wasn’t used as a check to measure your wealth, people would be much more open to the idea of micro apartments. Its all about changing the way we define ourselves.

I also want to make a note about the abundance of suburbs. Those were not created because people were leaving the city to live “simpler” lives. Most of that was due to “white flight” in the 50s and 60s. Yes, this might have caused disastrous impacts, but I disagree that it was encouraged because of an aversion to the negative environmental impacts of the city.

This is so important. A lot of people don't realize how much control developers and real estate companies control their local government and the development of their cities. We can have a voice in the change we want to see in our communities, but we have to use it! These big corporations are banking on the fact that no one pays attention to what is happening in their communities so that they can act in their own best interest. We, as citizens, need to do our part and pay attention and educate ourselves on elections and exactly what is going on around us. It is up to us, but we have to pay attention. I also agree that there is only so much we can do because these companies are so powerful and there is a lot that we don't know about, but if we do our part we can start to expose them and what they are doing and begin to regain some control. I had also never considered “white flight” as a reason for suburbs emerging, especially when in this class I tend to look at everything with an environmental lens. But, it is an interesting perspective and I agree that that played a role in the growing interest in suburbs. I had never thought of my suburban life as environmentally damaging, it had always been the norm. But hearing Ken talk about alternative housing options with one being even just as simple as moving to a city and taking up less room, I am reconsidering the environment in which I want to raise my children and my mindset is definitely shifting.


<br><hr>
Yes! I also disagree with Ken's comment on how suburbs were created. I think this issue goes back to one of the readings we had, The Waste Makers. So much advertising was going on during that time about what the ideal was for an American family once the war was over. The advertisements showed 4 person families in a big home with the newest car, the newest appliances, etc. Everyone wanted to fulfill this "American Dream". These ideals are still deeply embedded in American culture, it definitely has to do with the statistics of Americans owning bigger and bigger homes. We always think we have to be better than our neighbor. What about helping our neighbor and working together with them? Why do we always have to show we are better by having the biggest house or the newest car? I think if there was a study, people living in co-housing communities would probably be a lot happier than people in suburbs. I think the sense of community that co-housing brings is really beneficial and could improve many people's well-beings. I very much agree with the your statement on redefining ourselves. I wish we could just start over and that the ideals of success never existed. Success should be self-defined. I think we would live in much better world if this were the case.

Ken talking about this particular topic was interesting to me for one main reason: this is going to be MY potential future. Housing that is being built today and every day is creating an impact on our future and how our environment will be impacted. Every square foot of a house or building effects every other square foot on Earth, and that is so scary to think about. But if the methods that Ken mention are implemented and hopefully successful, then that will be positively impacting the climate. Any step in my opinion is a good one, finding traction to move forwards is worth the mistakes it will take to reach the goal of minimizing this insane crisis. Each person will have to change something about their lives in order to reach the goals that we have placed, but the exchange for the result is worth lifetimes

You are totally right - this is our future, and that is the theme I hope all of us come to realize by the end of this class. This is what we will face in the upcoming years, and we need to make changes in our lives in order to reduce this crisis. As Ken mentions, the average size of houses in the states is growing to extremes, especially when compared to the size of homes in other developed countries like Japan. Housing offers us the opportunity to start implementing that change, and as we students begin to graduate and move on from Isla Vista we will be faced with a choice of where to live. I find the growing environmental draw of cities to be very interesting and I am curious to see how we as a society can begin to change he structure of our cities to make them as green and sustainable as possible. This will likely include an emphasis on improving urban public transportation and building infrastructure up rather than building out. While in the past people avoided cities and saw them as an environmental nightmare, it is time to start looking at cities as a part of the solution when it comes to housing in particular.

My parents are currently in the process of moving into a bigger house. In their opinion, the American Dream has always revolved around bigger houses, fancy cars, and the best clothes that their hard earned money can buy. They're dreading that they'll have to live in an apartment for the next 2-3 months because the lack of space is something that they're not used to at all. On the other hand, I am planning to living Isla Vista after my first year and am looking forward to sharing my space with five other people. I could see going into the future and living in a big city like New York or San Francisco and appreciating the simplistic lifestyle of having only what I can afford and making as small an impression on the earth as I can. I think that it's special how Shivangi also sees the same future, along with so many other people commenting on this video because it shows how the American Dream has begun to shift. We're looking for easier, more practical ways of living and finding our own interests within the scope of a better, healthier planet.

Poor and lazy are the characters that may reduce the need for housing. For, example, the big city like New York, Beijing, have the unaffordable prices of land for most people. However, the excellent jobing resource the big cities still attracted a lot of people. Thus, people will live as small as possible to save money. Even more, the utilities of the big city are advanced. Public transportation is much cheaper and even quicker than private transportation. 

            <br><br>

With the development of technology, people became lazier. People lacked a lot of living skills, like cooking. More and more young people do not need the kitchen anymore. In the high population density city, food delivery and retailer like 7-11 are convenient. Blooming entertainment (especially with smart device) occupy people's non-work time. Thus, the kitchen will be unnecessary. With people spend more time on the virtual world, people will feel less sensitive about living space.

Listening to this lecture was extremely interesting to me for a few different reasons. First, the notion that living in a home with an 80 year life span would create 1.5 metric tons of CO2 per year, already accounting for a quarter of the average persons carbon footprint. I'm curious as to why moving to a micro-apartment would reduce someones carbon footprint, if they are living in a home and are not planning on funding one to be built. If someone were to leave their current home, wouldn't all of the CO2 emitted to build that home have been released for nothing? I personally would enjoy having a 185 square foot space for myself as the Adapt NYC Program allows for, as it would force me to experience the real world, and use my apartment/living space for sleeping exclusively, perhaps occasionally eating a meal. This is something I have gotten used to already and really enjoyed actually, as I am living in a single dorm room. I grew up in a six thousand or so square foot home in San Diego, and although the initial adjustment was difficult, I feel more connected with the natural world than ever before because I am constantly outside exploring this beautiful part of the world.

I too think I would enjoy having a micro-apartment in an urban area. From an environmental standpoint, the smaller space requires less heating and cooling, is less energy intensive, and reduces consumerism and accumulation (as there is no space to store it). From a sociologic standpoint, boiling the space down essentials highlights the shift we all need to make from wants to needs. As you mention, the area would exclusively be used for sleeping and the occasional meal, which would force people outside. Being out and active in a community is a driving force behind community trust, programs, and movements, which could include a community garden, shared meals, and general comradery. It is an extension of minimalism that forces inhabitants to reevaluate what they feel is important; the only reason I could imagine someone wanting an unnecessarily large house is to store all their unnecessary stuff, which occupies them and closes them off from the rest of society. 
            <br><br>

I think co-housing or micro-apartments in the city is certainly a feasible alternative that would be far greener than many of our current housing options (or preferences). Being a short distance from city life, including local businesses, would prompt a cyclic economic exchange, similar to the one in several UK cities mentioned in the film “Tomorrow”.
            <br><br>

What would Thoreau think? It’s difficult to say. The green movements that are occurring in cities, as well as the small housing options that are increasingly promoted and available would likely be in agreeance with Thoreau’s parameters for simpler living. However, as cities have a substantial amount of people, the quiet, simple, “back to nature” lifestyle that Thoreau preaches would be hard to find in bustling, busy city. This can be changed, though; creating parks, green roofs, urban gardens, and other projects bring nature into the city. I feel integrating nature into the city is a far better approach than integrating cities (or civilization) into nature.
            <br><br>

I will also be living in a single next year, as I do enjoy my own personal space (a luxury, no doubt), though the single room space I will be occupying is smaller than my room in my suburban home. Having lived in suburbia all my life - first in Illinois outside Chicago and now recently in Orange County outside LA area – I’ve developed a hatred for them. There is little to no public transport nor bike infrastructure and everything is far apart, making car transport necessary. There is no sense of community; I hardly see my neighbors and when I do, our exchange is detached pleasantries. Environmentally and socially, this is a disaster. Spurred on by the American dream, we have wrecked our environment and our social happiness.

I’m from San Jose, California which is a city of over 1 million people. The thing is though, I wouldn’t call it a city because it has a small downtown and the majority of it is just sprawling suburbs. Growing up I didn’t know any differently and I enjoyed it. I always wanted to live in a city with highrises and tons of people. After taking this class I realized that living in a city is probably the single most best way for me to limit my carbon footprint and live an environmentally conscious lifestyle. The average american’s carbon footprint consists of about 32% emissions from housing and energy and by living in a micro apartment or co housing this would limit my carbon footprint significantly. Also by living in a city with optimal public transit or use of bike lanes I could also reduce my transportation footprint. Today, the average american’s transportation accounts for 28% from car use and flying. By living in a city I wouldn’t need a car daily and if I really needed to go on a road trip I could rent one by using a zipcar. Additionally, I think it would be easier to find climate friendly dining since cities foster new ideas and industry. With all of these changes I believe that I would be living a happy and environmentally friendly life.
            <br><br>
Recently, I went to Seattle and I traveled everywhere by either walking or taking the light rail. I was amazed by how easy it was to get around in the city with public transportation. To me it was so much fun and I could see myself in the future enjoying city life. Historically, for 5,000 years humanity has seen cities as dirty and full of filth. Now there is a movement to bring nature to the city and make a combination of nature and civilization. One of the examples was the “highline” in New York city. I’m excited to see new additions to cities that would make them greener and cleaner. This would be amazing and I honestly think it would be beautiful. I 100% support this movement and hope it continues to grow.

It’s not the first time that Ken mentions that the size of house we live plays an important role in the emission of greenhouse gas, but this time, it’s more specific and impressive.What I never think of is that living in cities actually cause less emission of greenhouse gas, compared with living in the suburb. As he explains deeply, I realize that this can be true. Intuitively, most houses in suburb are large, which will produce more carbon dioxide in its building process. Living in cities, even in micro apartments that are similar to the traditional 400 sqft Japanese house, will for sure produce less emission. Aside from the emission produced by itself, living in cities will allow us to take the public transportation to the place we work and school we take, or it will take less time to drive to the place we need to go in a daily basis, compared with living in suburb. Also, since there are more educational, entertaining, and medical resources in cities, it’s really more beneficial and environmental friendly to live in cities.
             <br><br>

Even though there are so benefits for living in cities, the micro apartments mentioned by Ken are not so acceptable to some of us. People prefer to live in large and fully furnished houses, instead of the one with limited space. I doubt whether I will feel upset and depressed or not when living in a really small space year by year. Anyway, there are more and more people living in cities nowadays, and the area that can be defined as suburb are decreasing every year, due to the industrialization and urbanization. From this prospect, the industrialization is not totally a disaster for the environment, at least it helps more people move to cities from suburb.

I also agree that while I don't think every family of 3 needs a house of over 4000 square feet, I also don't see how possible it would be to expect people to move to co-housing communities. I personally couldn't say I would. I also found it interesting that Ken introduced the idea that living in the city could result in less greenhouse gases being released compared to the suburbs. However, it kind of makes sense because when you think about it, living in the suburbs requires you to commute pretty much every where and especially if you work in the city. While in the city there are so many forms of public transportation, in addition to walking.


<br><hr>
I think it should be noted that we’re not stuck between choosing a micro apartment or a mcmansion in the suburbs. Individuals have options for moderately sized apartments at affordable prices in cities, without necessitating moving to massive houses in suburbs and spiking our carbon emissions. These options provide a good middleground for most of us, as we can commute by public transit or walking in the city. In New York, for example, the comprehensive subway infrastructure allows anyone to commute quickly around the city, and is widely used. In addition, new road closures in Manhattan have increased bus usage and increased bus travel time considerably. Cities provide massive advantages in terms of both quality of life and carbon emissions.

I was surprised when I learned in this class that living in cities is more environmentally friendly than suburbs- it seemed really counter-intuitive. However, once we got to the unit on automobiles and mass transportation, it made sense that sense most people in cities rely on public transportation instead of driving themselves, that there would be significantly smaller carbon emissions than in suburbs where public transportation is small and unreliable. Public transportation is an awesome, convent, and really energy efficient mode of transportation. However, I do think that phrasing it as a solution is a little insensitive though,  as just up and moving to a big city isn't a realistic or doable action for a lot of people. Considering cities that have great public transportation systems like NYC and San Francisco are some of the most expensive places to live in the USA, I don't think an immediate move there is very realistic, especially considering most of us are college students so we aren't necessarily able to afford the rent of a smaller more eco-friendly apartment in the big city just yet. While I do agree that it is much better for the environment, I am curious as to what we could do now in the communities we already live in, like IV, to make them more eco-friendly and reduce our carbon footprint without having to move across the state or country.

I really like your comment and agree with all of the topics you brought up, especially about how right now what we as IV residents can be doing is aiming to make our city more eco-friendly. Although larger, more populated cities are better for the environment in terms of transportation, I am thankful that biking is such a popular mode of transportation here in UCSB. Although a lot of students choose to also have their car here, driving through Isla Vista is truly a pain when the mass majority of students taking up the road are biking, skateboarding, or walking. Although I once viewed this as a negative aspect about living in Isla Vista, I am now grateful that public transportation is so normalized and convenient here, along with simply biking/walking as a main mode of transportation. These forms of transportation are so much more convenient, that I, in fact, decided to not have a car here in SB after seeing how hard and inconvenient it was to drive places throughout Isla Vista.
             <br><br>

It really isn’t realistic that everyone after college is going to be able to afford to live in a large, busy city where car use isn’t very popular, which is why it’s important we focus on improving the circumstances in the cities we currently live in. After all, climate change is a serious issue that is literally getting worse by the day, so along with looking at what we can do in the future to improve this issue, we should also be looking at what we can be doing right at this very moment.

I was also very surprised learning that living in cities is more environmentally friendly than the suburbs. Whenever I think of suburban neighborhoods I think of foliage, clean environments, small shops, and even smaller populations. Meanwhile when I think of cities I think of huge populations, dirty environments, pollution, and noise. It definitely was interesting for me to have to reinterpret the way I think about appearance not always being in correlation with “better for the planet”. I agree with you for your reasons shared about why a solution being moving to a city is highly unrealistic. I am from a suburban neighborhood near San Francisco, and I have met so many people who can only live there because they some how managed to find apartments through families of a connection that had a rent cap on it. There are people living in closets of houses for $500 a month. It is unrealistic to think that we can push people in the direction of moving to a city just because it is “environmental activism” when the cost of living there will put you into debt. It reminds me of the systems of alternative transportation we have talked about in class. The reason people are unable to use bicycles and buses/trains is because there’s not a program in place that allows for that change successfully. If cities could be “rebuilt” in a way where it allowed for more people to move there and live in apartments that both affordable and functional, than I think we would be able to consider this a “solution”.

I found this lecture video to be surprisingly optimistic and positive. The video started out by revealing the large amounts of CO2 that are released as a result of housing, but it ended on a more positive note as Ken revealed many of the steps we are taking to improve city life and make it greener and more sustainable. I think that many of the changes taking place in cities are not important just for sustainability, but for encouraging more people to live in them. The idea of city living has two very different connotations depending on the person. Some people are drawn to the vibrant nightlife and upbeat lifestyle. Others, including myself, view the city living in a slightly more negative light. When I think of city living, I think of constant traffic, blocks and blocks of skyscrapers, and a lack of natural space. Many people are deterred from city life because they do not want to compromise their ability to be surrounded by nature, have a garden, or even have pets. Living in the suburbs and in more rural areas allows for all of the luxuries to be enjoyed. However, many major cities are taking big steps to challenge this notion and increase cities' green nature.  By creating gardens on rooftops, and transforming old railroad tracks into a park, people are able to live close to nature while still living sustainably in a city. These big changes are pointing us in the right direction. If I knew I lived down the street from a great park and could have a garden on my rooftop, I would be much more inclined to live in the city. I am sure there are many more people in our country with the same mindset as I, so if city improvements can draw in more and more people, we are succeeding.

I understand your view of cities because I also see it in a negative light. I did not think that living in cities was environmentally friendly because I have this negative view of cities where I think of them as overcrowded and polluted. When Prof. Hiltner began talking about 32% of our carbon footprint that comes from our homes, it made sense. I do not live in a city and in my town, I also do not live in apartments but instead in a three-bedroom home with my mother and two brothers. Since we were younger, we are taught that bigger is better and that it means your family is doing well for themselves. It makes sense why now, ⅕ of new U.S. houses are over 3,000 sq ft. When I was in high school I kept thinking that our house was too small for us and we didn’t have enough space. Now, I feel idiotic for thinking like that because based on the measurements Prof. Hiltner gave us, my house is bigger than we need. Despite this, I feel selfish thinking that I would not be able to live in a city where I can reduce my carbon footprint. I live in a town close to the beach and forests to hike in, and do not think I would be able to give up a nature setting for tall buildings and crowded cities. It was interesting to learn about the micro-apartment projects that large cities like New York and San Francisco are adapting. These projects are not only important for the environment but also for the social problems that these cities are having. Large cities like these two are known for having ridiculously high housing prices that leave people homeless, so these projects could help these people. I also felt better when Prof. discussed the ways that suburbs are also trying to decrease their emissions by growing veggie gardens and their livestock.

I actually really like the idea of co-housing! Of course, I understand the demand for one-family per house living, as I like my personal space as well. But, I feel like it's not too far fetched to like this idea. After all, as kids, my friends and I used to dream of living all together in a house. This idea of sharing spaces in order to help the environment could also help foster friendships/relationships in our generation, as it would help engage us with one another, instead of our phones/the internet. I like the idea of human connection, and I believe we would all be better off living closer together. As far as cities, I personally really like living within a short distance from everything, and I think city life would be incredibly fun. I grew up in the suburbs and was always plagued with the task of trying to find something to do. There was not much to do already, and with the trouble of having to find a ride wherever we went, it was incredibly difficult. While that's obviously not the most important detail by any means, it does stick out to me, because whenever I became able to drive, my friends and I almost always went to LA, a major city.

Smaller living spaces would not be too bad either. With space-conscious furniture, I think Americans can easily adjust to city living. These big houses that people strive for don't actually have any practical use that I have seen. What are people doing with all that space? Do we really need "guest rooms"? Or a pool in every backyard when there's a community pool down the street? Or even a balcony? None of these are essential. I think we all need to have a reality check on the difference between needs and wants, because of the dangerous obsession with the "McMansions". While I find that my generation has mostly tuned out this ideal, it is definitely alive and well. Celebrity influence, only perpetuates this, I mean, have you seen Kim Kardashian's house? It is a minimalistic hell with like a million rooms and a ginormous walk-in fridge that maybe holds six food items. At what point are we going to start calling out these people with wasteful lifestyles? I feel as though if we start to shun people with these lifestyles and continue our migration to the cities, maybe we can create a new ideal of environmentally sustainable/conscious living where we can enjoy the Earth, and each other's company.

The longer we are in this class, the more I learn that every aspect of our lives affects climate change. I totally agree with you: the concept of cohousing is really cool. It would be interesting to see housing contractors build upon the ideas of community living. Especially in states such as California, where the expense of living is higher and the people are more forward thinking. I envision this to be like an upgraded version of the suite-style dorms you see at our university; private rooms/spaces connected by shared kitchens and living rooms a could be a breakthrough in reducing our personal carbon footprints. By moving away from the idea that bigger is better, I think we can all focus on reducing our personal carbon footprints.

Bringing nature to the cities is an idea that I really love. Whether it be the designs of green architecture like in China, or incorporating small community gardens into urban settings, adding green to concrete jungles combats carbon emissions and makes for a better quality of living. Contracting sustainable buildings keeps the jobs of construction relevant whilst also opening a demand for environmental techniques in building. China has been a trailblazer for creating ‘green apartments,’ where plants are grown on the buildings themselves; it’s a futuristic idea that brilliantly encompasses the need to move away from traditional, space-wasting living. Much like the benefits of cohousing, community gardens foster a connection between neighbors because it calls for connecting with the people around you. It’s a win for both our society and our environment.

 In response to Ken’s question of Thoraeu’s lifestyle in an urban setting, I think that’s not a good question. The essence of Thoraeu’s lifestyle was the rejection of normal society, to strive for alternative living because people were too wrapped up in the complexities of status and appearance. From his book, you can tell he immerses himself in the woods because complete nature was the ultimate escape from the toxicity of human society. Sustainable city living calls for a different mindset: to cut back on excessiveness of materials so that we can continue to live in a society where the air is free and our years aren’t numbered.

I completely agree with your point that there is so much wasted space in suburban homes and large houses in general. I never really questioned the necessity of pools and multiple guest rooms because it was the norm for me growing up. I grew up in the East Bay in an area where nearly every house had more than one guest room and thousands of unnecessary square feet of space. And as you pointed out, even the large suburban homes in my town don't even compare to the massive amount of space wasted in celebrity houses. I don't even use 80% of my house at home, so I can't imagine how many rooms in that house serve no purpose. Before college, due to the area where I was raised, I was kind of dreading moving into a tiny dorm after having lived in a house for so many years. Admittedly college students are lower maintenance than most adults, but I actually really enjoy living in a room where I have everything I need within arms reach. Although lack of storage is slightly problematic, if I wasn't sharing the room with another person, that amount of space would be completely sufficient. However, even when considering this, it's hard to imagine wealthy individuals wanting to give up their houses for small apartments. Just like fancy cars and flying, having a large house is a status symbol and seen as part of the American dream. I too hope that it becomes a norm to shun people will such unnecessarily large houses.

<br><hr>
I agree that Co-housing is actually a really great alternative to the single living that is so common here in the US. I currently live with 6 other people and though I don’t think it’s exactly what Ken met by co-housing I think the idea of living with others is actually easier than living by yourself or with just one other person. We all contribute to the work around the house and are able to split groceries and household items which makes living with others a positive. After years of living with other people I actually think it might be hard to live by myself. I definitely agree with you that living in co-housing is a great way to engage with other people! I also agree that the idea of city living comes with a lot of conveniences. As you pointed out everything is close and you have more options for fun things to do. Also, as Ken has pointed out cities have much better public transportation and by forgoing a car we actually can save a lot of money and more importantly reduce our carbon footprint. I used to be under the impression that city living was bad for the environment. I would see all the smog and traffic and assume that cities contributed a lot of pollution. However, knowing what I know now about the transportation and micro-apartments it makes more sense how downsizing and not relying on a personal vehicle for transportation is way better for the planet. 
                <br><br>
      I totally agree with you that these giant mega houses really are so wasteful because there is no way that it's getting used to its fullest potential. Like you said, having a guest room seems not essential. One could easily get a couch that can pull out into a bed. I really appreciated that you made a point to mention the amount of celebrity influence our culture is getting via social media. It can be really hard to see them living this “lavish” lifestyle and still feel content with what you have. It has been so engraved in us that having it all is important. I have definitely seen Kim's new house on TV and couldn’t agree more with the ridiculous paradox she lives in.

<br><hr>
I like how you mentioned that as a kid, you and your friends used to dream of living together, because to this day I still dream of living with my friends. I feel like not many people consider co-housing, which is crazy because how fun would it be to live with a bunch of your friends and also be more environmentally friendly. I also grew up in the city and have always lived in an apartment, and I actually like the space and the convenience of being so close to everything. I feel like big houses are such a waste of space and resources. Nobody needs those Kardashian size houses, and we should be more conscious of their effects on the environment. I totally agree that we should create a new ideal of more sustainable housing/living because it is better for the earth and for our relationships with others as well.
<br><hr>
I think your comment hits the nail on the head. When I was younger, I lived in a home small enough where I shared my bedroom with at least one of my siblings until I was about 13. My family's current home is a bit larger, but I'm still going to be rooming with my sister over spring break because my aunt is visiting us: no need for a guest bedroom, in my opinion. Now, in college, I've lived in either a double or triple room, sharing a larger communal housing structure (last year the dorms, this year a house in IV). I honestly love rooming with other people, even though I'm very introverted and need to have time and space to myself. Rooming and sharing a house with people who almost always have very different methods of living has taught me patience, bettered my communication skills, and made me value my interpersonal relationships more. It's nice to know that there will always be someone in close proximity who can help me out if I have an issue. And we consume so much less if we accumulate material items as a community rather than an individual; from clothes to cooking utensils to the houses themselves, more people in a single living space can consume less than if they were in separate spaces. 
                <br><br>


Smaller living spaces really aren't unmanageable; like I wrote earlier, I'm introverted and tend to lose my cool if I spend too much time around other people. But living in a city like IV (or any city really) means that I can always find space to be by myself. From the library to a park to a coffee shop to the beach, no matter what mood I'm in I can find a public space to give me some room to breathe. To adjust our climate impact in terms of housing, we need to prioritize safe, inexpensive  and well-maintained public spaces. To this end, I think of a quote by George Monbiot: "private sufficiency, public luxury." This idea means that we can have beautiful gardens, Olympic swimming pools, fantastic and fast transportation, grand libraries, and magnificent parks, but these things must be collectively owned and maintained to remain within our ecological boundaries.
<br><hr>
I agree that so many houses contain so much waste of space and we really need to as a society reevaluate the way we look at homes. I know so many people, my own family included, who have dreamed of owning their own giant home. But for some reason, I never felt the same way. I actually detest large homes and find them rather creepy. It’s weird to me how so many people want massive homes with more rooms than family members to live in them. Although people say they want these homes to fill it with all of their family and friends, more often than not it’s rather empty most of the time. And like what you said, do we seriously need guest rooms? I’ve watched celebrity home tours on Architectural Digest’s YouTube channel, and a startling amount of times have I seen the homeowners with giant mansions say they rarely have people over and have a small family that can rarely fill the large amount of space it takes up. I know some people want bigger spaces to have more privacy and trust me as someone who has shared a room with her younger sister her whole life and then continued to share rooms at the dorms here in college, I totally get it. But with homes so excessive and unnecessary, I think it can go from feeling private to feeling lonely really fast. Your comment on Kim Kardashian’s home is also very poignant, as she is constantly flashing her wealth and mass excess on her Instagram. How can she try to pass of her home as “minimalist” when it is literally a 320-acre estate that is supposed to be home just to a family of six? It is celebrities like her that perpetuate this excess and materialistic culture that makes people think they should strive for these homes that overall could cause more harm to the family than good.

I agree! The idea of co-housing sounds great, but to a certain extent. I’ve had the ability to live on my own for a bit, but it kind of sucked. It was just a boring experience that got old really fast. Now that I have roommates, I really like having a place to share. Sure it can feel cramped and small, with no privacy, but at the end of the day it's great to be around people, and if it happens to help the environment, then I’m all for it! I agree with all that you said about large homes and how they are essentially useless with all of that space for only a few people. 
                <br><br>
Now, my only problem with co-housing is with families. I’m ok with co-housing when all of the members are single or a couple at the max. I don’t know who would want to share a home with a family. And I say this from experience. I’ve lived in a rather large home with 3 families sharing it, 9 people total. And it was not a great experience. There were arguments over bathroom use, laundry machine use, kitchen use - you name it. While the idea of co-housing is fine for a few people, I personally don’t like the idea of it for multiple families.

<br><hr>
An invasion of privacy and a loss off freedom is something that nobody really want. Sad enough this is how a lot of people think about co-housing and downsizing their houses. Especially because, as you described, they have dreamed of a big house with a pool, guest room and a happy family in it. Throughout history humans have proven to be especially bad at compromising their own PERCEIVED wealth and wellbeing in order to help others. This concept is something that our capitalist, free for all society strongly stimulates. We are tuned to associate big houses, cars and privet jets with happiness. What I find so marvelling about your comment is that you managed to address all the positive points about the idea's in this video. If we could change peoples PERCEIVED idea of wealth to be something more like in the film we watched this week than this could initiate a cultural shift. I like that you are so forward thinking about all this and hope you manage to 'activate' as many people around you to think like this!

<br><hr>
I too really like the idea of co-housing for the same reason that many comments above mentioned. Although I need my space, I’m glad I had the opportunity to share a living space with others because it forced me to improve my communication skills and adaptability. The fact that so many comments here and in previous comments have stated something along the lines that transitioning from living in a house to a co-housing situation is totally possible. Because college has limited housing resources for students, we are given the opportunity to experience co-living. If the general population could be given some kind of incentive to switch to smaller, community living experiences, then the 32% housing emissions would drastically decrease. Unfortunately, in this day and age, owning your own house is seen as a sign of success, and bigger the house bigger the status. There is still too much of a demand for single family supersized houses, but hopefully the next generation of house owners would be more open to the idea of co-housing as we are more educated about the correlation of climate crisis with housing and the rise in housing prices.
<br><hr>
Co-housing with the concept of micro-apartments is a fascinating concept which can benefit our personal carbon footprint. To clarify, the housing situation in America entails the average person owning a 2,500 square foot house. Houses, to cut into carbon percentages, is roughly 17% heating while the other 15% takes over other applications. The rest of our carbon footprint goes towards transportation(86%) and Food(14%). Every year, 6.13 billion square meters of buildings are constructed which equivalents to approximately 3729 million metric tons CO2 per year. I agree with your statement around the stigmas around celebrities and the elite to shape the way people view as desirable.

                <br><br>

I was also quite surprised to hear that moving to cities are actually better than moving to an urban area as Henry David Thoreau acted on. Although there are many buildings in a city, transportation can be limited as people will be more willing to walk or bike to work as stated in the lecture. Bring nature to the city not the other way around. Personal gardening is a beautiful way to help change many things within our society including health, wealth, and resources. Last weekend, I went to volunteer with the Edible Campus Program and I helped clean up gardening spaces for residents to use in Santa Barbara! This event helped open my eyes to how we can reuse spaces redeemed as unfit into a place where the community could grow their own food for affordable amount in comparison to markets. I think housing is similar to a garden space as one may think that such a small space may be inhabitable, but it really takes one to be open-minded towards the new in order to make a change.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with your comment! The idea of co housing and micro apartments stood out to me as it reminded me of how we already live here as college students in Isla Vista. My dorm room is probably no bigger than 150 square feet with three occupants living in it and share a bathroom with two other people in the room next door. The floor shares a microwave and the hall shares a kitchen. Everyone in Isla Vista lives with multiple housemates because the cost of living is so high. Co housing sounds like a way for people to build better community relations as our individual housing does create a sense of isolationism as a lot of people do not know who they're neighbors are. In Isla Vista and the dorms there is a great sense of community within those living there. Why does that have to leave once we leave? I feel like Americans are very estranged from each other and do not have a general consensus of community and helping other people. That could be fostered through co housing, building social capital and helping the environment. Micro apartments are also a great avenue for minimizing the environmental impact of housing while still retaining the sense of privacy and ownership people want. I think the desire and stronghold people feel over their big houses is the feeling of "success" that comes with it. Our whole lives we have grown up with the mindset of growing up to become rich and have a family and a big house and cars. To many people, their McMansion is a way for them to feel as though they've made it and to show it to other people that they are successful. The idea of success linked to it is also reinforced, as you mentioned, by celebrities like the Kardashians where people choose to watch them walk around their huge house. Big houses are celebrated and flaunted all over pop culture and media and that makes people associate it with wealth and success. As long as the culture of success being linked to how big your house prevails then we will struggle to get people to adapt to microhousing, minimalism, or co housing. Ken was right when he said this was a culture issue; people want to feel successful and like to show off in society and that directly correlates to the need for huge houses. We need to change the culture and normalize sustainable housing through mainstream media and pop culture since that is what people are most receptive to. I was glad to hear that cities like San Francisco and NYC are taking steps to try to promote micro housing and other green techniques like rooftop gardens etc to make urban areas greener. Thinking about all of those honestly makes me excited for when I think of a community like Isla Vista that has co housing and lots of green everywhere from composting, gardens etc. Isla Vista is what the rest of suburbs and cities should see as an example as everyone here bikes/busses, lives together and there are lots of recycling and greenery everywhere.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with you! For me, it was not until recently that I came to the realization that living in a big city is most appealing lifestyle to me. Even though I grew up in the small cities surrounding LA and frequently visited the city itself, I had always been intrigued by the busy city life and by the physical closeness among people. I remember having many conversations with a friend of mine about the future: we would find a small apartment in the middle of LA, with the hope of living in the same area as our work. Because of this, I think that the idea that cities present opportunity remains true; however, just as we have learned from Ken’s lectures in the past, there is still work that needs to be done in our cities to support a sustainable lifestyle, including improvements in infrastructure renovation and resource accessibility. 
                <br><br>


I also think this idea of a simple lifestyle that Ken has presented is more than possible. While the city life will be enjoyable, I can see myself in the future wanting the space I live in to be simple and stress-free, hence without clutter or extra stuff I will not need and living in the dorms has already taught me what my necessities are as well as how to cope with living within a community. As you explain, we a lot of luxury lifestyles that are maintained by celebrities, but I like that you point out that these multimillion-dollar homes are impractical yet are commonly desired. My hope is that it will be our generation to finally change the direction of the American lifestyle towards one in favor of sustainability and social equality in our cities.


<br><hr>
I totally relate to your childhood dream of living with your friends when you grew up. I remember fantasizing and making elaborate plans with my cousins about how we'd all live together with our parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles in one big building. I think the reason people want bigger homes is simply because they have a lot of stuff, so the only way I can see this becoming practical is if we first popularized minimalism. If people stopped spending money on random unnecessary things, they wouldn't have the need for a big house to keep their things in. The only other things a home can provide are comfort and shelter and any sized house could do that.

                <br><br>

I like that you mention that a lot of the rooms in a house are pretty useless. Privileged people dedicate rooms to create gyms, libraries, study rooms, gaming rooms, etc., and none of those are essential to human life. All of the activities that those rooms are created for can easily be done in any other place.
<br><hr>
This video made me start a self-reflection about my own life. I grew up in a big city with a population of 21.5 million, so I rarely enjoyed nature in the first fifteen years in my life. After I moved to Minnesota, a state with thousands of lakes, for high school, I realized how beautiful our planet is. However, the beautiful nature was covered by buildings, lights, and traffic in my home city; I’m happy to see how fast the city develops, but I also feel that the younger generation needs some nature to embrace. A few years ago, my parents decided to move into a larger house. I used to be excited about having more personal space and a larger garden, but now I’m thinking about whether my family really needs such a large house. The fourth floor of my house is a dance studio that I rarely go to after I left home five years ago, so it’s kind of a “wasted” space since no one else uses it. So I do agree with the idea of co-housing that was talked about in the video.
<br><hr>
It's funny that you mention growing up and talking with your friends about living together because I remember my friends and I would always make fun plans of buying a house together and having fun dinner nights, game nights, and movie nights all the time. Obviously, as young teenagers, you hope to have a huge house with an enormous backyard, but after living in a house with 5 other girls this year, I've realized how much fun a smaller house can be with your friends because you don't really need a whole lot of space. I definitely think that having a smaller living space is something that is extremely beneficial for the environment along with being cost-efficient. Cities are especially nice because like you mentioned, everything is within walking distance and you don't have to worry about the carbon impact of a car, and as a bonus, most cities have a good public transportation system in place.  Overall living in a smaller space within the boundaries of a city is not that large of a change for most middle-class people and is truly one of the best things to do to help reduce your carbon footprint. 

                <br><br>

One thing that I enjoy about Isla Vista living that at first, I thought I was gonna hate, was the exclusion of air conditions in a lot of the housing options. While some houses like mine have a heater, we do not have an air conditioner. This not only saves us money but also saves the planet.  Luckily we are in a location that has weather that allows for no air conditioning to be possible, places like Arizona and Texas would find it extremely difficult to limit AC usage, due to the heat during certain months of the year. With that said I do believe that whenever there is a nice day, we can work on turning off the AC and instead enjoy the outdoors while helping to save the earth.

<br><hr>

I completely agree with your comment! I totally remember being young and sitting at a computer designing my future house that my best friend and I were going to live in together with out future families. In a sense, I actually prefer the idea of co-living seeing as I am a very social person and enjoy interacting with others. Co-living is actually very similar to dorm life here at UCSB. Currently I live in a triple, in a really small room with some of the best people I've met in my life. While before moving to college I would have easily argued for more personal space and privacy, I actually believe this form of living is very doable. I love the idea of being able to have these social interactions while also doing a great deed for the environment. There is also seemingly a bunch of other benefits of co-living not even discussed such as safety and the dependability of others for reliable responses. In terms of co-living in urban areas, this could be a great solution to the rent issue in these metropolitan areas, in which rent is so high because there is not a lot of options for people to live in. Similarly smaller more eco friendly apartments not only fit the current generations aesthetics but also help reduce carbon emissions which I find super interesting. I would 100% support societies transformation away from desiring these mega mansions and becoming realistic with how much space is necessary for a single family. Plus less cleaning for smaller places which is always a plus!!
<br><hr>
I agree. Growing up from the cities and raised in an flat, I still remembered my first time visiting the suburbs in perimeter Atlanta and how the sizes of the house shook me. Most of these houses have at least 3 levels and 2 door garage, and some are even shaped like giant medieval castles. These luxuries were beyond my imagination, since the flat I grew up in only had 3 bedrooms, 1 kitchen, 2 bathrooms and 1 living room all combined. Now thinking back at it and I can’t imagine all the costs for maintaining temperature and running electric appliances too. It would not only be a huge bill for the family, but also a huge bill on the environment. I spent a couple of sleepovers at one of my friend’s houses which happens to be a giant castle too. I was surprised when I heard him say most of the spaces in the basement, which includes the biggest bathroom in the house, a small gym and a crafting room, were left untouched, and I couldn’t stop thinking what a waste they made of those spaces. On the other hand, we had everything we needed in our flat and it wouldn’t take 3 minutes and get from one end to another. Meanwhile, the energy we save with less electric appliances help us reduce everyone’s climate footprint in the household too.
<br><hr>
I also was very fond of the idea of cohousing. For my entire life until reaching college, I lived in the suburbs. I was spread out from my friends and things to do. Like you said, even though you would think the space would be nice, it was very hard to find things to do. When my friends got their driver’s license, we almost always drove to San Fransico. I always thought it was great, and thought of how awesome it would be to live there. The problem with San Fransico is rent is insane. Cohousing could partially solve this problem by bringing down rent significantly. Ken mentions in his lecture that the average housing size has gone up 150% since the 1950s. This seems insane and unnecessary. I also agree that our obsession with McMansions (houses over 4000sqft) is completely unnecessary. By contrast, Cohousing in the city would be similar to dorm life at college, which I love. Living around tons of people, some who you know and some who you don’t, but still having your own small shared space (the dorm), is pretty great. Apply this same lifestyle of living in a city, with shared appliances and suddenly costs of living go down and things to do go up. Life could be more than just 40 hr work weeks and a drive back home to the lonely suburb. The one thing that has always scared me about cities though is how overwhelmed and chaotic living around so many people can be. I’m curious if anyone has a solution for this; because often when visiting SF, or while living in Santa Barbara, I feel overwhelmed by the number of people I’m around and interact with. I also agree with the second part of your response, a lot of what we want in a house these days is completely unnecessary. Spacious backyards, pools, extra rooms, and other features of a house aren’t needed by individuals. Rather let that problem be solved by cohousing, where you have one pool, one spacious area, and one set of guest rooms shared by a group of people. This way these places get maximum usage and don’t go to waste. Living in the silicon valley, I far too often visit other people’s houses where it seems as though 20% of the space gets used 80% of the time, and then 80% of the space gets used only 20% of the time. Some areas aren’t even accessed ever. Generally, I could see a switch to cohousing and micro apartments being a manageable change for the future and one that also brings more happiness and fulfillment to our lives.
<br><hr>
I also like the idea of co-housing. Living with a bunch of your friends sounds really fun. And we all don't have to give up our personal space as I saw a co-housing video last year and families lived together in a small community with separate houses but communal cooking, dining, and (I think) bathroom areas.

                <br><br>

I also grew up in a suburb and I feel the pain of having to drive everywhere. The bus system in my hometown was pretty bad and slow, and there were a lot of hills so walking wasn't an enticing option. Most of the time I just stayed home and didn't do much until my friend got his license, which allowed us to do things, but at the cost of putting CO2 into the atmosphere.
                <br><br>


Smaller houses are great as well. They cut down on resource-intensive, unnecessary parts of a house (as you said), and they make the area of the house smaller, which is way easier to maintain. Both small housing and co-housing are great options to have in the future for living, and I see myself in one or the other in the coming years.
<br><hr>

I also see benefits in co-housing. I would not mind living in co-housing, but I feel it is pretty much only appealing to certain audiences. It would be fun to live with friends from college or other people of similar age and interests. However, if one is older and has a spouse or kids, they may find suburban housing with their own place and backyard may seem more fitting. Like in FRIENDS, Monica and Chandler move to the suburbs as they believe living in an apartment in the city is not the best place for small children.
                <br><br>
In the near future, I believe I will find myself living in a city, specifically the Seattle area. I have spent a bit of time in cities over the summer and visiting friends. I have had mixed feelings of the different cities I have visited, but overall, they have been very different from the suburbs where I have spent a majority of my life. I did not really like New York when I visited my friend who goes to school there, as it felt very crowded and smelled bad. I did however enjoy staying in the Bellevue/Seattle area last summer. There was a lot to do and was still very close to an abundance of nature. 
                <br><br>
I also wouldn’t mind a smaller living space. While at home, currently I don’t really do much except study, sleep, and eat. As long as I have enough room for a bed, desk, and kitchen, I think I would be completely satisfied. There is so much space outside to do other things like exercise or meet up with friends.
<br><hr>
I remember doing the same thing as you and making plans with my cousins about living in the same house. Even recently, I’ve had conversations with my sister about living together in the future. I like the idea of co-housing and micro apartments. I fee like when you live a huge house or have a big area to yourself, you tend to buy more stuff. It eventually becomes cluttered, messy, and unorganized. I prefer the idea of a micro apartment because I can have more privacy, even if I’m sharing it with one other person. One of my biggest problems is that Im constantly buying stuff that I don’t really need. Living in such a small area would allow me to reevaluate what I really need in my home. It would also decrease the amount of food waste, since I would only buy what I need since I’d presumably have a smaller refrigerator. If I had a family, I would definitely rather do co-housing. The idea of living in cities can sound bad to people and that is understandable. I’ve visited Los Angeles many times. The streets are dirty, the traffic is horrible, housing is expensive and the saddest part is the thousands of homeless people on the streets. Maybe if there’s a shift of interest towards city living, it will become a priority to help individuals who need it and improving these cities. As Ken said in the lecture, we have to rethink the idea of cities and we also have to rethink their potential.

<br><hr>
I also find co-housing an appealing solution, which isn't a unique opinion as evidently obvious by the popularity of your comment among many others in this comment section. Housing isn't as prominent of an environmental issue in the media or news outlets, those platforms are usually more taken up by car emissions, renewable energy, etc. However, I'm glad Ken acknowledged and stressed just how detrimental the current standards of housing are for the environment. It's preposterous that the American dream has swollen so much that it is no longer success, but the material attention seeking measures, like McMansions, that are the ideals now. People are exponentially taking up space that they do not need to live and eventually that area will run out. That amount of space is much better suited for concepts like co-housing wherein a greater amount of people can take better advantage and waste less resources individually whether that be food, water, or energy. So many needless additions to houses are put there for convenience sake, only to go unused a majority of the time. For example, a pool is often added to a house as a luxury option that is sometimes partaken. However, 99% of the time that pool is just going to sit there, covered up to avoid messy things falling into it. A community pool is a much more reasonable budgetary option as it will always be an option and will always be in use when business is there.

<br><hr>
I cannot agree more with your statement about how bigger living spaces are unnecessary. When I was a child, I always imagined living in a mansion with everything I could ever imagine in it such as a personal gym, a theater, and even a mini outdoor water park. Now the idea of having all of that in my living space disgusts me. I want to be able to step out of my home and go on adventures without feeling like I already have everything at home so why would I go out. We live in a society that obsesses over the fact that nothing is ever too much. This idea is what got us into the severity of the climate crisis. If we were to reexamine how we live and think about what we actually need to live a "good" life, 90% of the things we have would not apply. I agree with Ken that housing in regards to the climate crisis is a cultural problem, especially since we live in such an individualistic society. 
                <br><br>

To be completely honest, I do not believe that co housing will ever become the norm especially in the society we live in today. However, I do believe that is a reasonable solution that more young people will take part in, especially since housing is becoming more and more expensive. Sharing a space with other people other than your family seems like a crazy idea, but if you truly think about it, it is not as far-fetched as people make it seem. Especially if one has moved out of their home to dorm. Two years ago, I would have thought that co housing is not something that is reasonable. However, going through the experience of forming has broadened my views and made me rethink how I want to live in the future. Many people, however, do not have the experience of dorming and will continue to think that housing is meant for just your family or yourself.

<br><hr>

I like how you considered co-housing, it makes me think about this post on social media that showed these pods like living situations and they just looked so nice. They were like little neighborhoods and thinking at it after reading your idea it seems like a really good idea. Honestly it would be nice because not only will there be financial savings, the people you will visit literally live right next to you, you won't even need to drive to go visit them. 
                <br><br>
The city idea I am in between, like you it would be nice to be close to everything but also it would be so crowded. From experience I know that being in downtown LA is so hectic, and personally I hate crowded spaces so it wouldn't be the ideal situation for me. Finding something to do though I can relate to that, I hate where my home is located because literally to get to fun places it is like 30 minutes to hours. So that would be the only ideal reason for considering living in the city. 
                <br><br>
I agree with you, your whole second paragraph is right on. Literally I don't understand the obsession with huge houses. All that space is so unnecessary they really need to fill up their homes with unnecessary things as well just make their homes not feel empty. The mention of the Kardashians, especially Kim, O.M.G., literally every time I see something having to do with her house it pisses me off. Literal huge ass unnecessary space, huge ass mansions for her and 5 other people. I could literally rant about how unnecessary her home is, all those rooms, huge af too for her tiny ass children. The time she posted about her children's play room, omfg!!!! All those toys literally probably bought that many because the room was the size of an apartment. We really need to shun these types of living lifestyles like you said. It is time to make minimal homes a trend, buy what is needed not wanted.

<br><hr>

I agree with this comment completely, I feel that the housing trending now and the idea of McMansions is wasteful and useless. The majority of the space is decorative and not being used, people are also having smaller families now, which makes the houses purely decorative and for showing off. However, I do see that the younger generations are not affected by this, as my cousin and her husband are both well off and she is a physician. They could afford a larger and separate home, but they chose to reside in a condo and I highly respect this decision. They are close-knit with the neighbors and this form of communication is also something I strive for, as growing up my mom never let me play with the neighbors and their children. I always wanted to become close to my neighbors and form that bond.  This is very attainable if we moved to cohousing. Along with becoming more social in person, we will drastically lower our carbon footprints. Personally, I think this change is very doable and not a huge change to my lifestyle. As I have always lived in a crowded home, then moved into a triple my first year at UCSB, and now a double in my apartment. I have learned that I quite like the company.


<br><hr>
Although I agree with your whole comment, I think the most important part you mentioned was in the last paragraph. We, as a generation and those below us, strive for the "American Dream" our parents came to America to attain and for the lifestyles of celebrities that seem so fun and simple. The rate at which social media consumes us has caused this huge increase in the influence of celebrities online and the increase to the already high amount of consumerism we see in America. Rather than begging for and working extremely hard and depressing hours to gain the lifestyle of the celebrities we all desire to be, I think we can easily try and change what is seen as cool and fun. We, as the young generations, need to switch in our mindsets what we see as fun and cool and what we see as dangerous to the earth and unsustainable. If we show that we don't support the lifestyles and give them no attention on social media, we can basically force these influencers to take upon different lifestyles that are more eco-friendly which would decrease American consumerism and hopefully lower carbon emissions.
                <br><br>


If the stigma towards living in co-housing and micro-apartments is reduced and people show how cool it is to live in a sustainable way, then people will join this movement in America. Although it is a lot to ask of everyone to follow this movement, I think young generations will see the benefits of this which is most important because we are the ones that are going to lead our country in the future (in politics, businesses, and as activists). Hyping up sustainable youtubers and influencers is a great start because they can make this trend a lot more popular and lead us to really act in the right ways.

I had always thought that it was bad to live in cities because cities produced more pollution than suburban and rural areas.  In my mind, as more people moved to cities, the cities would expand, thus producing more pollution.  As a result, I did not find living in a city desirable.
                <br><br>
After taking this class, I have come to realize that this is not true.  I had never questioned why I thought living in a city would produce more pollution than living in a suburban or rural area.  Now I see that it makes sense to live in a city if you want to reduce your carbon footprint.  Living in a city means living in a smaller space and depending less on your car as transportation, meaning your carbon footprint is greatly reduced as you are using less energy to power your living space and you do not use a car as much because everything is closer together in the city and driving is more inconvenient in general.
                <br><br>
I believe that it is a good thing that more and more people are attracted to the idea of living in a city because this would greatly reduce the amount of carbon emitted due to cars.  This is good because we do not need to spend much effort convincing people to go live in cities because this is something people are already willing to do, even if they are not doing this with the environment in mind.  Even though something like this is still not enough to stop the climate crisis, it is encouraging to see that we are somewhat making efforts towards reducing our carbon footprint.

Your comment caught my attention because I resonated with the points that you made. I've lived in a triple for the past two years at this school and I honestly don't mind. Growing up, I've always had my own room and a lot of personal space to do whatever I wanted. I was a little scared to live with two other girls during my freshman year because I thought I wouldn't have enough space. My mom raised me to not throw away my things, so naturally I have a lot of "stuff" because I simply cannot let go of my belongings. However, after living in a triple, I've realized how easy it can be to live in small spaces and to learn how to share communal space. Rather than throwing away things, I began to donate them or sell them on UCSB's Free and For Sale page. As I moved onto my second year and my peers found out I chose to live in another triple, many were shocked and wondered why I would put myself in such a small space. I genuinely do not mind sharing a bedroom with other people because it teaches you to be flexible and grow accustomed to different living styles. It's also a lot of fun, as you had mentioned. I love coming home and being able to talk about my day to a couple of other people, as well as unwinding with them. Cooking in a communal space is not only fun, but it has allowed me to grow my culinary skills by learning from others. Being surrounded by other people's company is very reassuring because I feel safe knowing that other people are there. Thus, I am not opposed to the idea of co-housing. A lot of Americans have learned that being successful means having your own McMansion with luxury cars parked in the driveway. However, if we take a step back and think about what's really important for our earth (and happiness), the idea of co-housing seems a lot more attainable.

<br><hr>
although I understand that co-housing will bring us closer, I am not a fan of that idea. I have tried to live with different roommates and share all the amenities with them. However, it just doesn’t work out. We all have different lifestyles,and it’s difficult to cope with that. Besides, the argument between the loss of items and cleaning is a huge challenge. For these reasons, I think that co-housing can only happen when we are sharing space with our families or close friends.
                <br><br>

On the other hand, smaller living spaces is a more practical alternative to co-housing. A smaller living space maintains privacy and contributes to lowering greenhouse gases. Big houses are definitely a waste of resources; we do not need a large space to sustain our lives.

<br><hr>


I am in love with this comment and could not agree more! The idea of co-housing and creating meals together and doing fun activities with housemates sounds incredible. I am so excited that I get to live off campus with a lot of friends next year (maybe a small taste of what co-housing would be like!) I also grew up in the suburbs and a car is needed to get everywhere from my house. Biking is an option but the roads are not super safe (the whole "shoulder is the bike lane” situation) and the buses do not go out to a lot of the suburban residential areas outside of the city. I would love to be in a city with lots of fun activities to do, but also one with a green outlook. Normally cities are imagined as concrete jungles and pretty gross places to live. I think this idea can be totally reimagined for rooftop gardens, permaculture plots, mass transportation, and a better sense of community. If we can revolutionize the idea of a city, not only will they become healthier places to live, but also healthier for the environment.
                 <br><br>

I would also agree that people have way too much space in their home's that is normally just cluttered with a bunch of useless stuff. I think that the idea of sharing needs to become re-popularized. I should be able to borrow things from my neighbor and they should be able to borrow things from me. Also you're completely right, why does everyone need a personal pool when we could just have a totally awesome community one? The individualistic drive and pressure that is placed on us in America seriously needs to be challenged. We can have more fulfilling lives, with simpler houses, and less stuff.
<br><hr>


You make a great point! I grew up in the suburbs and I've always wanted to eventually to buy my own house in a suburban or rural area to better surround myself with nature. I associated the city with pollution, cars, buildings, and concrete. I wanted to be around a lot of trees, grass, animals, etc. and be one with the environment. However, now I've come to realize that living around a lot of trees, grass, animals, etc. wouldn't be convenient nor would it be good for the environment! Ironic isn't it?!
                 <br><br>

It would be more environmentally-friendly to live in a city and take infrequent trips to suburban and rural areas than to live in a suburban or rural area and commute for an hour every day just to go to school or work.

<br><hr>

I agree with your thoughts in smaller living spaces. I honestly would enjoy living in a smaller house. They're usually cheaper and take less energy to heat or cool. I feel like most of the space in houses is wasted and people buy furniture to fill in the space. I wouldn't like co-housing because I'd prefer to live by myself and have some privacy. It would be nice though to live in the outskirts of a city where it's not too loud. Everything you need is near you and you won't need to own a car to get to places. However, personally I'd prefer to live in a rural setting since I grew up in a small town and I like that lifestyle. Overall, I agree in living in smaller houses since it's more energy efficient and space is not wasted.


<br><hr>
I grew up in a tiny town and found that I was always looking for something to do. My parents somewhat took up the concept of co-housing, but it was out of necessity. The cost of rent was so high that it was financially smarter to co-house. I remember growing up in a house with about 15 other people, some children around my age. While it wasn't the most ideal living situation there were many perks to it. You were able to save money and spend some more money on other things that could benefit to one's happiness, or you could even work less and be able to spend more time with loved ones. The idea of bringing nature into cities is a great one. It is environmentally disastrous for people to live in the suburbs and have to commute on a daily basis to their work place. 

                 <br><br>

Furthermore, I completely agree. The McMansions that Ken describes are only glorified examples of one's wealth with little regard to the environment. How many cars, rooms or pools does one really need to be happy? Not only are they being environmentally disastrous, but they set an example to millions of impressionable followers. There is also a new younger population of "influencers" who shoot videos of their massive homes and cars just to show off their wealth. This "flex culture" is not only consumerist, but it sets the example of what "success" should look like. It's definitely our job to unfollow, and put pressure on these influencers to be more environmentally conscious rather than reinforcing their wasteful lifestyles.
<br><hr>
I think that having your own home and living alone is tied to the American idea of success. Having roommates and sharing spaces has been looked down upon as something you do until you can afford your own place. Personally, I was nervous to come to college and have to share a room with two other people. I grew up in a rural area and have had my own room since I was two years old. However, since coming to college one of my favorite things has been having roommates. They have made me a more social person and we can rely on each other for motivation and support. Next year I am sharing an apartment with four other people and I couldn’t be more excited. I understand that people with children and families prefer having their own space, and that makes sense. However, I believe that we need to get rid of the stigma surrounding living with roommates. It is not just a stepping stone to success, it can be a comfortable way of living. Humans are social creatures, and I for one am happier sharing a 10 foot by ten foot square with two people than I was in my room at home. Not to mention sharing housing is much more cost effective.
                 <br><br>
 Living in communal spaces also opens up new areas for creativity. Like the architecture and design of tiny homes, apartments and shared homes could open up new venues for design.

<br><hr>
You're right, the suburbs is where boredom fosters. For some reason, I think distance scares Americans. Why are we so afraid of the time it takes to get places? Having spent a few weeks in Ashiya, Japan this summer-a relatively suburban location-no one seemed to have a problem riding their electronic bikes everywhere. The streets were designed for bicyclist/ pedestrian priority and only offered 2 lanes max for car travel. Japan's public transportation system does an excellent job connecting its suburbs to major cities-something the U.S. is capable of but for some reason focuses its priorities elsewhere. Having visited a couple of countries in Europe in addition to Japan, it seemed as if the people in both of these places understand what it means to live and are aware of what their actions do for the environment. Why is the United States still on the other side of this awareness spectrum?
<br><hr>
I fully agree with you on this idea of co-housing. While it may be quite an adjustment for many Americans, I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad one. In addition to the tremendous environmental benefits, I think co-housing would provide many new social positive elements not typical in most american families. I think co-housing could further engage individuals in their communities and develop close personal connections which many would appreciate. Like you, I really like the interconnectedness of cities. Growing up in Shanghai, I was well acquainted with most of my neighbors in the apartment building.  When I moved to a more suburban area, that sense of interconnectedness was gone. The environment made it harder for me to engage and become acquainted with the community. I feel like modern american families can often be isolated from the community and co-housing could be the solution to that issue. From this perspective, co-housing isn’t necessarily downgrade for the benefit of this planet.

<br><hr>
I also feel optimistic and supportive of the ideas Ken presented in this lecture: living in a city, living in a small space, and living amongst other people. I can relate to living in a place with nothing to do, having fun seems to take so much work, whereas living in a city means that you are probably walking distance from a few enjoyable things! I also think that co-housing seems nice. When I was a kid and my parents were still getting on their feet we lived with my grandparents– it honestly couldn't have been better. It was more affordable, there was available child care, more helping hands around the house, and family who loved you ever present. I wouldn't have minded living with more of my family as I grew up. Obviously living with people will help you be closer to them and wanting to have close familial bonds or friendship bonds is a very human desire that I think many people could get behind. 

                 <br><br>

I think that in the US especially people are brought up valuing financial success and showing that success through possessions, especially homes. I know that Ken has made that argument clear, but I think that more people need to talk openly about how there is a disconnect between happiness, possessions, and financial success. I disagree with the bit of your comment that says that our generation has mostly tuned out this ideal. I can go on twitter and every day there is a viral tweet that is captioned something along the lines of "This will be my future home, I will speak this into existence" and pictures of multimillion dollar homes with spiral staircases, gorgeous views and huge infinity pools. Yes, you're right that celebrity influence supports this desire. This ideal is still prevalent and it remains needing to be debunked.

<br><hr>

I agree with your comment on co-housing. It is also something I've thought of doing back home with some of my friends from high school. Even living in smaller spaces is something I'd consider doing. I really don't find the need in having for instance a two to three story house or even a mansion when I know I won't even occupy most of the space in the first place. Choosing a smaller living space is something I'm already experiencing right now by living in the dorms, and it has honestly been an enjoyable experience. I found that having a more minimalistic living space helps us value what we have more and it is even a great way in helping the environment. As far as city life this is something I find very convenient when everything is very close in distance, whether its the market, our jobs, or just a place to have fun. It is especially more convenient when everything is at a walking distance. I have family members in the suburbs though that have to travel miles just toget to work or even drop off their children to school. This is why I find it more useful living in the city, and is a great step in helping the environment.

<br><hr>
I objectively agree with everything mentioned above. Just to talk more about the adjustment in terms of smaller housing, from this lecture video, moving to smaller housing appears to be a very achievable solution and a very easy solution to implement. To pivot on this point, smaller housing does provide tenants with a much-reduced rent to pay. Furthermore,  lots can be developed in small housing to optimize large amounts of space as mentioned in the video. This then provides individuals with more fulfillment as they are being efficient and making the most in their living spaces.  I've read in many articles that there's a large amount of population in the US who don't even use most of their respected living space in their giant houses. This proves to be infuriating as it just contributes to the very problem addressed in the lecture video. It was very interesting to see those featured in the documentary,  living in small housing spaces, emphasizing how they felt that every part of their house had some sort of contribution and purpose to their lives. This further emphasizes the idea of greater fulfillment by living in smaller houses. In general, I personally think that although there are generally a lot of benefits associated with smaller housing, I don't believe those reasons outweigh the reasons/fulfillment of living in bigger housing.

Within this lecture video, the concepts of micro apartments, cohousing, and cities were brought up. I figured that the houses have supersized during Ken’s lifetime, I mean as we have seen in this class, a lot of things that impact the environment have changed during his lifetime. However, I was shocked to find out that the average house size now is 2500 square feet. As a person who has always lived in small apartments, I never fathemed that the average person in the US would live in such a place with a huge square footage. My heart nearly dropped when Ken mentioned that 1 out of 5 of new US houses are now over 3000 square feet. I am used to living in an apartment that is less than a fifth of this size with numerous family members, so I cannot imagine the amount of space in these 3000 square feet house, how much stuff might be in these homes to fill up the extra space. Then Ken attempted to give me a heart attack once again when he said that 1 out of 10 of new US houses are now over 4000 square feet. I’m glad to know that I most likely would not be the only one completely baffled by these statistics because in Japan the average home is 400 square feet. I can only imagine what the Japanese must think of us as a country. For me, knowing these statistics makes me completely disgusted because we have so many people in the US who are homeless or cannot afford certain housing, but it’s no wonder when all the new houses are so huge. I can’t help but think of how some people who live in houses these big have “guest rooms,” while some people cannot even get a roof over their head. Some might think oh these people can just go to a homeless shelter but fail to realize there’s only a certain amount of room in these shelters and that there is an application process, meaning they can’t just show up and automatically get a roof over their head. If we did not have all these big houses as our average, maybe we would have enough physical space to make more homeless shelters or more low-income housing.
   <br><br>
    Homes nowadays contribute so largely to our carbon footprint. For instance, 17% of the average American’s carbon footprint comes from heating and cooling their homes, while 15% of the average American’s carbon footprint comes from other energy related uses in the home such as lighting. Thus, 32% of the average Americans carbon footprint is correlated in some way to our homes, that means nearly a third of our carbon footprint is somehow related to our homes. This 32% is more than any of our other contributors such as 28% for transportation, 26% for relentless acquisition of stuff, and 14-16% for food. 80 metric tons of carbon are released just to even build a typical house. The average American has over 2.5 times their annual carbon allotment for their homes, keep in mind this is not including the stuff we put inside the homes. In order to greatly reduce this aspect of our footprint, we can move to a micro apartment or cohousing. Both seem like great solutions because in all honesty we do not need the amount of room that the average US house is and cohousing seems like it would make us more connected to our community because for cohousing they share services and amenities with others in their community. Another great solution to reducing our carbon footprint would be living in a city. Typically, cities have less car use. For instance, in Manhattan only 1 out of 5 people get to work by car and generally live in smaller and more efficient housing.

I agree with this comment.  Before taking this class, I thought my home was a little on the small side.  Now that I have seen the statistics, I realize our house is about 25% bigger than it should be for my family.  Not only is this a waste of space, but it is also a waste of energy.  
   <br><br>


As to the part about what other countries think, I know they would be shocked.  I spent last semester all over Europe and everywhere I stayed had much smaller rooms and instead offered communal public areas.  Though this makes sense for a hostel, I also saw the same theme in my apartment and various hotels.  
   <br><br>


Lastly, I was surprised to see how much pollution owning a house causes annually.  I guess it makes some sense when you think about all the various activities and functions a house serves, but the numbers were truly mind boggling.  Though my family is very stingy when it comes to heating and cooling our house, 15% is still a huge amount of our annual footprint.

<br><hr>

  I have gone to Europe before as well. When you compare the size of even a room from the US to a country in Europe it’s completely mind boggling. Some people in the US have rooms that can fit a king sized bed and still plenty of room to roam around. Meanwhile, I think a king sized bed in a room in a European country would quite literally be the whole room. As for you, which method do you think is better micro apartments or cohousing? And which one would you personally do?

This lecture makes it clear that the American Dream is unrealistic because it is not sustainable. I was pretty surprised to learn that houses in the 1950s were 1000 sq ft but now many houses are triple, even quadruple that size. Growing up in a four bedroom house with a family of four, I loved it. It was spacious and you have your backyard and such. Before I entered middle school we moved into a one bedroom apartment in a more expensive area. It felt very crammed and I did not have much privacy. It is always shocking to know that Japan on average lives 1/10 the size of an American home because I am already not a fan of a one bedroom apartment. We later moved into a bigger home of two bed rooms. However, living now in IV in yet again a one bedroom apartment, I’ve learned to love and appreciate it more.

After graduating from UCSB, in the long run it would be nice to live in a house with a family. However, now knowing that  housing accounts for 86% of the carbon footprint people cause, I am going to have to be more mindful. I was very surprised that Ken encouraged people to live in the city. I expected him to encourage us to live the Walden like lifestyle, but I realize Ken gave the most realistic living solution that is more environmentally friendly. Since 55% of human beings live in cities, it would be good for the planet if we lived in micro houses and community housing. I wonder how long it would take for everyone to get on board with this though. I wish for even myself I desired to live in a small micro home after college but I, like the majority, still would like the american dream of living with a family in a house.

I think a house is much more than just a roof to live under. It is a direct status symbol in our society. I mean what immediately comes to mind when someone says he/she lives in Bel Air or Beverly Hills? Anyone with these zip codes would be automatically presumed by others as the top one percent or, at the very least,  fairly wealthy. Because location and housing play such as big role in determining one's socioeconomic status, of course most people with the financial capacity would want to live in the biggest, most luxurious houses. The ironic thing is that people purchase these big houses hoping for the best for their families. They want their kids to have their own rooms and bathrooms, plenty of yard space to run around and maybe even a pool. Of course, let's not forget that there must be at least one guestroom. However, why does anyone need that much extra space? The bigger the house, the more physical distance and mental isolation each member of the family can potentially feel. If a family conflict ever occurs, how much easier would it be to just escape to a corner of the massive house instead of resolving the conflict with each other? My parents often tell me how much they regretted moving into a house. When I was younger, my family lived in a decent sized apartment, where we had so much family time and memorable experiences together. However, after moving into a big house, I realized how often my parents had to tell me to come out of my room to join them for a movie night or a family event. Before I knew it, I was feeling so disconnected to my own family. Even nowadays, my dad would often joke that he will sell the house and move us back to a small apartment.

I completely agree. So many people buy houses simply because it enhances their status without thinking about how a larger house could potentially alienate family members. Like you said, when a conflict arises, instead of being forced to talk to your family members about it due to small living quarters, a large house makes it much easier to escape to your room and distract yourself with your phone. This yet again highlights a fundamental problem Americans have. Too many people think a larger house will make them happier when in reality a smaller house may be perfectly fine for a good family connection. I mean, is there any evidence that suggests that wealth is an indicator of happiness? I believe once you are above a threshold where you are financially stable, your happiness depends on the relationships you develop with family and friends, and not the sum of your bank account.

Before I watched this video, I always thought that the city is a very polluted place, and the city is full of tall buildings and countless cars. And because of the problem of architecture, there are often very few trees. Because of these conditions, I have always thought that cities have nothing to do with environmental protection. After watching this video, I am more convinced that minimalism is the best way to reduce my carbon footprint. For a person's life, the apartment is certainly a very good choice, often the apartment will be built around the supermarket or shopping center, which can not only bring convenience to people's lives but also reduce the number of people using the car. For family life, I think most people prefer quiet and beautiful places. Although apartments are the best choice for office workers and students, they are not suitable for everyone. So I think the housing problem can only reduce the individual's carbon footprint, but they help the global climate is very small.

Yes King. You know what's up. Minimalism is where it's at. #apartmentdwellersunite. Lmaoooo but anyways, yes. Living a minimalist lifestyle would definitely lower our carbon footprint, which is crucial for the survival of this planet. I have lived in an apartment for my whole life. As a kid, I disliked it. I wanted to live in a big mansion. Now, I realize, I don't want or need that. No one does.

Great comment! I think many people are like me, who is shocked after watching this video about living in a city can reduce the average carbon footprints. I believe the terms of a city in many people’s head are hugely influenced by some movies and the history of urbanization. Let’s start with why people believed city is a place that are crowded and polluted at the first place. Back in high school, I learned from the history class that the first emergence of city first started with urbanization, that is, the invention of factory requires more people to live in a smaller and crowded place in order to maximize the productivity. The production of a factory always comes with pollution; however, those large factories were removed from large cities from a long time ago. Thus, it is not surprised that many people are still holding this “stereotype”. As the professor says in the video, living in a city means less travel distance, less living area and less carbon production. I think this way is totally viable. Nowadays, many cities are transforming into the both economic and political center, it is possible that living in a city is the future solution to the climate crisis.

Change our life living in urban cities to rural cities is not impossible and can’t be done; however, as for most of us living now, it is actually hard to completely change our lifestyles to the one like Theodore has living in Walden. It is because most of us are actually relying too much on consumption, technology and the type of lives give us so much convenience. And we always think that it is a life goal to work hard and earn money so we can buy our own house. A lots of those suggestions of eco housing are actually really some great ideas, but how much people are actually willing to change from living in an owned and private place to live with so many people are actually hard to predict. However, after hearing how much the average housing size have changed over the years and how much greenhouse gases can be emitted from a house shocked me. 
         <br><br>

The ways Ken suggests in the video are a nice way to reduce emission of greenhouse gases. Even though not all of us are willing to make some of the changes to their lifestyles base on, the video also suggested that it is time to see the problem from housing can cause climate issues. It is important to think more about how we can make some changes to the ways we are living our life and even if it is just a small change, such as using less air-conditioning,etc, are what we can do from the aspect of housing.

I do agree that movement into the cities is an important remedy for limiting the climate crisis. This issue of housing also makes me find Thoreau's Walden all the more interesting because it essentially questions the life that Thoreau romanticizes as the return to a truer human nature. Turning away from the cities would seem like a good idea at first but clearly it wasn't. Now we have freeways and way too many oversized homes. Moving into a micro-apartment in the city doesn't sound like such a bad idea when considering the fact that housing, clothing, and transportation accounts for 86% of carbon emissions. This statistic further emphasizes the idea that changes not only have to happen politically, but also personally. If there is enough personal action being taken to alleviate the consequences of climate change, not only will politicians and corporations will notice, but carbon emissions would be drastically reduced.

It's interesting to think about "Walden," something that for a long time I considered the hallmark of eco-friendly, minimalist living, as potentially less eco-friendly than big city living in modern day societies. I love what you said about it re-emphasizing personal over political changes. I believe that if we all can change how we act and consume, corporations (and money) will follow, and politicians follow the trail of money and public opinion. In my hometown, there's been vast changes to create sustainable living spaces; I think that younger generations love a nicely laid-out apartment close to the action downtown, regardless of its size. I grew up in a big house with just my parents and one sibling, and as some consolation it was built in 1919, so it definitely has become more and more carbon efficient. However this video has me consciously questioning whether that house was worth the good times I had in it at the sacrifice of the environment. It certainly uses a ton of electricity and other resources. But my dad was always saying the problem with a big house is that there's always something going wrong, we would be fixing or cleaning something new every week. Simplicity is the answer to many first world problems.

Many of us are at an age of independent living. I think community housing or micro apartments are the form of climate activism most available to a lot of us right now. As young college students, I think co op housing is something affordable and helpful to our budget and planet. It caught me off guard when Ken said that family sizes are going down but houses are getting bigger. City living also seems like a viable option. Granted, not everyone can make that change, but a city home does seem like an easy adjustment, everything is within an hour of eachother. City living would reduce transportation emissions because of the common tendency to use mass transport. 
         <br><br>

Based on other lectures, I was aware that humans are well over their CO2 allotment. I found it interesting when Ken said eating healthy and less meat is imp
ortant, but housing, transportation, and stuff is 2x more important to cut back on. Still, transportation is the leading factor. Roughly 80 metric tons of green house gases are released to build a house but a car is four times that. Not to mention, all the utilities that release emissions on top of building that house. The average 32% of carbon allotment goes to home utilities not leaving much left for the common daily lifestyle we choose to live. Converting to micro apartments or co housing with solar panels can be the best move for people in non city living.

I agree with you and believe that the solutions Ken outlines in this lecture video were reasonable and practical. Before coming to UCSB, I dreaded living in a triple and sharing one room with two other girls. However, after two quarters I have grown to not only tolerate it but love it! There is so much life in our small room and we have become incredibly close because the three of us are constantly in such close proximity. Moreover, we have had to get creative with how we organize all of our stuff and keep only the stuff we use frequently. I know for a fact that we use every square inch of our room, compared to the average American house where only 40% of it is used. In the future, I can definitely see myself living in a micro-apartment or even in community housing/co housing because of the myriad of environmental and social benefits it entails.

I was surprised to learn that moving to a city can dramatically decide your carbon footprint. Cities have historically been viewed as crowded and dirty, but this is on longer the case. We need to rethink our perception of cities. Cities can provide hubs with a variety of parks, shops, utilities and more for a diverse group of people. One of the reasons that cities are not viewed as desirable is because people like to have access to nature and gardens. To resolve this issue, cities need to take action to include green spaces or parks throughout the city. Furthermore, by living in a city you can know that you are making an environmentally beneficial choice. Living in cities dramatically reduces transportation emissions, limits urban sprawl and excessive land use/habitat destruction, and more.

Like most others watching this lecture, I was honestly very surprised to hear about how bad for the environment suburban living is in comparison to living in cities today. The pre-existing associations I have about cities is that they are the result of mass industrialization, and have caused wide-scale economic inequalities and pollution. So, the first time Ken mentioned that moving to a city would reduce my carbon footprint, I was definitely surprised. I’ve known for quite some time now that animal agriculture was a huge contributor to methane emissions, cars and planes are obviously terrible for the environment, and Americans’ excessive waste and greed is of course largely unsustainable. But living in Manhattan could be better for the environment than living in Wyoming? This just didn’t intuitively make sense. I’m personally from a small town and don’t like the idea of a large crowded city as my home. However, I found the idea of a “green metropolis” to be very intriguing. Living in a micro apartment or a small home where I can have my own small garden and efficient public transportation does sound appealing to me. Even though it may be different from what the ideal American home is, I think our generation could get a lot out of city life, while having great implications for the environment.

I too was very surprised when I learned how bad suburban living is for the environment in comparison to city living. Usually, when we think of suburban lifestyles, we think of nice greenery and comfortable living, while city living is seen as packed and busy. These notions about cities are because, like you said, the result of mass industrialization that leads to wide-scale economic inequalities and pollution. When Ken mentioned that it would be better for the environment to live in cities than a suburban area, I was taken by surprise. However, it makes sense that living in compact housing and using public transportation is so much more beneficial to the environment. In a suburban area, on average houses are mich larger and people use personal cars to get to different places. Now that Ken mentioned it, it seems obvious that city life would be better for the environment. More people in a smaller space and also fewer resources needed to get to different places saves so much. I hope that we can spread this message and encourage more people to try to have city life and eventually reduce our carbon footprint. It is very possible that if we stay conscious of our environment and take proper action to take care of it, we can eventually stop this climate crisis.

I 100% agree with you. Before watching this video, I always considered city life heavily polluted, wasteful, and not eco-friendly. Even though I live in LA, I thought our carbon footprint was extremely high considering the insane amount of cars and the terrible traffic. However, after Ken explained how suburban communities are worse than cities due to how big the houses are and how much one depends on their car to get around - I was astonished. I understand that more people living together in one place is better for the environment since less houses have to be built and sharing resources with one another is higher. I just keep thinking about the fact that when an area is more populated than another, there’s bound to be more carbon dioxide released into the air. Thus, it’s still taking me awhile to wrap this concept around my head. It feels very counterintuitive. By any means though, co-housing would be a great step forward into reducing our carbon footprint. We need more human connection with each other and if we can achieve this and look after our planet at the same time, then it’s a win-win.

Housing accounts for 32% of the average Americans' carbon footprint. 17% CO2 produced by warming and cooling the house, and 15% CO2 comes from lighting and something else which consumes energy. However, there is a fixed CO2 emission produced when the house is built, and it is about 80 metric tons CO2. Furthermore, the fixed production is increasing since the houses in the US are becoming bigger. Just like Ken mentioned, American houses were about 1000 squares feet before 1950, but houses are about 2500 squares feet now. Putting on reef solar panel can hardly reduce a large amount of CO2 footprint. Thus, to reduce the personal CO2 footprint and mitigate the climate crisis, a person can live in a co-housing community or micro-apartment. Also, move to a city is also a great idea, because people can live in a micro-apartment and take public transportation to work, and it will reduce CO2 footprint as well. New York has launched a program to encourage micro-apartments, and a room for a person can reduce to 185 square feet.Nevertheless, living in a micro-apartment can not reduce a person's CO2 footprint as effective as living in a co-housing community. By sharing the kitchen, even meals, it will effectively reduce one's CO2 footprint.

 In my perspective, it is not necessary to have a big house and lots of unnecessary stuff. However, people are pursuing big houses and lots of luxury clothes which is brain-washed by the advertisements that advocate only big house and luxury clothes can manifest dignity. In China, there are many people who spend their whole working to buy a house, and they get lots of debt to buy a house. In fact, it is not necessary to own a big house in the capital, and it can not display one's prominence. They can live in a small apartment, but they can spare more money to do some meaningful things instead of paying the debt every month and worrying about running out of money.

I agree with what Professor Ken said in this video that cities now cover the majority of the surface of our earth, so if we want to change the environment and solve the environmental issues, we need to start with changing the lifestyle in cities. When Professor Ken mentioned that the growth of people moving to urban and Suburbans is a climate disaster, it reminds me that, in previous courses, while talking about consumerism, the material mentioned that the car advertisement always pictures the beauty of urban areas where people have to have a car to go to. What they are doing is not only selling cars (we can say that selling cars is their business) but putting more pollution by encouraging us to drive and go to urban areas. The damage to urban areas has been noticed since many people followed the trend of David Thoreau. However, they are still encouraging people to buy cars for going or living in urban areas. This is not so right. Anyway, the change should start from us. We can change this by building our cities into a better place. How? Just like ken mentioned before. Changing our lifestyle and being environmental activists.
            <br><br>


The issue of the house are very similar to cars, I noticed, that people always ignore the carbon emission being put out during the manufacturing section. Looking at the data collected for measuring people’s carbon emissions in each sector of life. The energy use and so on doesn’t look like a big part. Yet, while combining them together, it is a number that should indicate to us what to do and what is the most effective thing we could do. In conclusion, changing the way we live in the city is important to solve environmental issues.

I agree with you as well, and found your tie to the car industry and cities to be interesting and something I have never thought of. I feel like as a society we often overlook and are simply blind to the realities of the lifestyle we live  pertaining to our choices of home and its effect on the climate crisis. I don't think we are intentionally being negligent of our carbon footprint, but we simply are not educated on the effects. Before this course, I would never have known most of the statistics and huge impacts that my daily life has on my carbon emissions and the climate crisis, especially coming from my house. Personally, I always dreamed of making enough money to buy my own big house in the suburbs. And honestly, up until this course I still had those dreams. Now after watching this video, and seeing the contributions to our personal CO2 emissions just from our homes, I am open to reconsidering these dreams. I have never been fond of city life myself; I am from the East Bay Area where I can visit San Francisco as often as I want. While SF is a beautiful city that I truly love, I would never imagine myself living there long term at all. But if we are going to work to mitigate the climate crisis, as you said, we must change our lifestyles. I have a long time until I will need to consider owning a home, but from this video I now know the best environmental options and will do my best to implement them into my future. To be honest, the options that Ken suggest do not appeal to me at all but I believe that is because it is something I am not familiar with and seems new. I think I could find them appealing over time as it is a better option for the environment and I am always open to making changes for the better.

When I think of cities, I think of mass industrialization. From the early 1900s, big cities like New York have created massive amounts of pollution and trash. However, they are the best thing we can do for the environment as of now. To live in a city, specifically a micro apartment, one is reducing their emissions by using public transportation or walking everywhere, minimizing the amount of energy their homes use, as well as using virtually less stuff in their day-to-day lives. Luckily for me, I am eager to move to New York after I graduate college. While there, I will not own a car and utilize public transportation, as well as share a small apartment with my friends. I highly approve of the micro apartment movement and hope it expands throughout the next few years. In the meantime, I will find other ways to lower my carbon footprint.

Hi there I totally agree with your comment and I am also planning to move to New York after graduating college! I was also surprised to see that living in the city would be much more environmentally-friendly and green compared to living in the suburbs because we tend to associate city life with more pollution due to the crowded condition and how compacted the cities are. However, as Ken mentioned that is totally not the case. Living in the suburban area is usually more environmentally damaging and costly because of the larger houses and the main transportation method, which is the automobile, that release a large amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The extensive public transportation system in cities such as New York is a major reason that city life is more beneficial to the environment and to the issue of climate change because fewer people commute by automobiles in cities as more people use public transportation to get to work and school. The ideas of cohousing community and micro-apartments also sound very exciting and promising as living in cohousing communities or micro-apartments not only allow us to live in a place where space is highly efficient and maximized and every corner in the house serves a purpose such as in the case of micro-apartments but also connect and bond people through living under the same roof and sharing various housing facilities and equipment which in turn increase people's happiness level by connecting them to others. All of those great things are all done while reducing our personal carbon footprint which is always a plus and important in the discussion of the climate crisis. Therefore cohousing community and micro-apartments are really the ideal housing options for us in the future as more people move from suburban areas to the cities.

I used to want a huge house with all the luxuries what we grow up hearing from adults. As I learn more and more about the negative impacts on not only ourselves but the environment, my aspirations for a large home have completely changed. My personal outlook in life and my genuine concern for the climate crisis has influenced my aspirations for sure, but if you really think about it - what's the point of having such a large house. I would rather have a cozy microapartment or small home, then a two story ( 2,500 sqft ) home that is neither necessary nor cozy ( or sustainable ) . This outlook in life not only helps the environment, but it helps your personal life as well, as you will no longer strive to show of what you have, but rather have what you truly need. 
            <br><br>
As a child, I remember when my parents would drive down a wealthy neighborhood and I would see all of these HUGE homes that looked incredibly cool and just amazing - and after learning about just how unsustainable and unnecessary they were, my perspective on them completely changed. I mean come on, do you really need your own basketball and tennis court that you only use twice a year, or that completely useless fountain. From time to time, I come across these youtube videos showing multi-million dollar mansions that are just full of unnecessary commodities. How anti-social or just down right reclusive do you have to be to NEED your own theatre. Some of the commodities that these multi-million dollar homes come with are just ridiculous. The same feeling I used to have with these huge mansions, I now have when I pass by small homes or even apartment buildings.


<br><hr>
I used to picture large cities as ground zero for pollution and contamination because of mass industrialization as well. But after hearing how much cities are doing to become more eco-friendly my thought process has completely changed. I live pretty close to San Francisco and I could never have pictured myself living in such a big, crazy city but after hearing how it can extremely lessen our carbon footprint I can say I’m now considering it. Growing up in a suburb, I had previously believed that it wasn’t bad for the environment but now thinking about how we don’t really have mass transportation, options for more sustainable housing, and the fact that we have McMansions surrounding the whole town makes me feel very guilty. Not only do I want to lessen my own carbon footprint but I want to inform my town about how urbanizing can actually be one of the best options we have as a society to reduce our current emissions.

To answer your question about micro houses, I’m gonna say that it does sound strange because it is not what we are taught to look up to. We have grown in a society where the bigger the house, the wealthier one is, thus we look up to the acquisition of cars, a big house, etc. Nonetheless, throughout this course I’ve learned about the impact that these ideas have had over decades on our planet and this lecture just taught me something new. I never thought that living in cities and suburban areas was by far a better sustainable way of housing. Additionally, it does make sense that within cities people are more susceptible to live in smaller houses, and use public transportation more compared to rural areas where I can imagine people will be in a much need of cars to move around. To me it seems as if the best solution to reduce our housing carbon footprint is, then again, to live in a more minimalist life. Furthermore, I agree with Ken about approaching this situation as a cultural problem, he mentions that within the last decades house sizing has significantly increased, thus contributing more to the release of greenhouses.

My first thought was also that the idea is strange. To be honest my first thought was absurdness. I thought that there is no way I want to live with other people in groups homes, I want to have my own home with a yard for my kids and have it in my own style. In the midst of those thoughts, I kinda realized that- that's what I was trained to want. That's the "American dream". Then I thought to myself, is that what I really want or is that what I'm pressured into wanting. So many of our ideals are shaped by how people say we should live. And there needs to be more of us who realize that we can do better. Switching to the city- sustainable living does not have to seem like a compromise of what we want. What ken decribed in this video did not seem awful, incorporating nature into cities is not a burden, its overall better for us. I would be open to sustainable city living and I think that if more people were just open to ideas we would be able to see results much faster

I agree with you that implementing a communal living situation would be a very big cultural change for people who have spent their entire lives living in spacious single-family homes. We are so accustomed to having large bedrooms and multiple bathrooms that downsizing seems like a big downgrade. However, I think that transitioning to smaller houses and communal living could result in great social consequences in addition to environmental ones. For example, my family of 4 has a pretty large house with multiple bathrooms and living rooms. My sister and I each have our own room in which we spend lots of time.  My dad usually occupies one living room while he watches the news and my mom occupies the other watching her show of choice. Our family has adopted this pattern, and I have found that most of the time we spend relaxing and watching tv, we are not actually together. We spread out into the many rooms of our house, because we have multiple rooms. This trend results in less time being spent with one another. If we had a smaller home, I think we would gravitate towards spending more family time together watching tv in the main living room instead of watching tv separately on our own devices. I do not believe that moving into a smaller home would alter my standard of living a single bit. Americans do not need 2500+ square feet of space for a 4-5-person family. If anything, I think having slightly less space would bring my family closer together. 
             <br><br>

A communal living environment would have a similar consequence as well. There are many people who live alone, or just with a partner. Communal living would introduce them to new people and create lasting relationships. When people with all different backgrounds come together, lots of insightful information and customs can be exchanged which I think really enriches people’s lives. Overall, these types of living may seem very arbitrary to someone who has grown up in a very different living situation, but the environmental and social consequences seem to be very promising and enriching.

The idea that a family would buy a larger than necessary home to fill it to the brim with material goods that they barely use or need is cringeworthy to me. I know that the way society and culture is set up, it makes people feel that they need certain items to be fulfilled or deemed as successful, but it’s just not the case. I think this is where mindfulness and self-consciousness plays a role and doing things like meditating can help, as Peter Kalmus suggests. The topic of housing reminds me of my aunt because she at the moment lives in a moderate-sized house with just herself, her husband, and her toddler. The house is definitely big enough for them to live comfortably and including me when I go home to visit, but my aunt always talks about getting a bigger place which is just worrisome because I know she’ll just recognize the extra space as an excuse to buy more things to fill it. Things like cohousing that Ken mentions in the lecture peaks my interest because not only is it more sustainable, but it fosters community and cultivates a collective effort for the benefit of everyone instead of just yourself which is a huge stepping stone to understanding the climate crisis at its core.

Growing up in a town of 100,000 people, I had always wanted to see what it was like to grow up in a place like San Francisco, where there is always so much going on and people all around. I loved the idea of always having something to do and somewhere to go when I stepped outside my door. With this being said, I see myself post-grad living somewhere like San Francisco or New York, where I can experience this lifestyle. However, the cost of doing that is extremely difficult to afford, especially for a 20something who is competing in the job market and blah blah blah. Realistically, I will probably end up living in a suburb close to said city, like a place similar to Antioch or San Mateo where housing is much cheaper, and commute each day to work as housing is inhumanely high in cities like San Francisco. If I were to want to live there, I inevitably would be living in a co-housing situation, and I feel as if when I’m young, single (or not living with a boyfriend), and childless, this is a feasible option and I would not mind sharing that space. However, the only issue I find with this is later in life I definitely will want to have my own space. This isn’t to say that I would not be okay with living in a more condensed area, but I don’t necessarily want to live with a whole family along with mine in a home. Maybe I missed the point of this, and that is not what is being suggested, but I feel as if the most sustainable goal from the idea of co-housing in this video would be that and I am not that down. I could see myself living in a big building, apartment style, separate living situations, shared gardens, the whole thing, but there is a level of privacy and comfort that I feel like all should be able to have.

Similar to what you said, as I was watching this video, the first thing that came to mind was the cost of living in a city. I grew up in a suburb in the Bay Area but this past summer I had the chance to live in San Francisco for a few months. While I agree that the public transportation system was very convenient and most people in the city seems to use that (or walk) instead of having a car, the money I saved on not using a car was greatly surpassed by the amount that I had to spend on rent and the general cost of living in the city (including inflated prices on meals, etc). Because of this, I think in order to make it possible for more people to move to the city and live in smaller houses and use public transportation, the first step must be to create affordable housing in these cities.


             <br><br>

On another note, I do agree that there has been a huge increase in the blending of the urban city and nature. This has been really exciting to see, as not only is it great for the environment, but it also adds to the appeal of moving to a city (which in turn also helps the environment). As Ken said, a lot of major cities are incorporating rooftop gardens and urban farming, and I think that this will only increase over time.

In my eyes, I always thought of cities as the opposite of eco-friendly. The city to me meant litter on the floor and pollution in the skies. Anytime I would visit big cities both the ground and air would not seem clean because of garbage and air pollution from factories. This is probably why it is so hard for me to wrap my head around the idea that cities are one of the best things for the environment right now. It is a new way of thinking for me, and probably others, to see living in a city as a beneficial thing for the environment. But, when you break it down and really think about it, it makes sense. Apartments and living spaces in cities are incredibly smaller than in suburban areas. Smaller homes use less electricity and energy, reducing carbon emissions. Living in a city also reduces the need for cars and makes it easier for people to use public transit. Because cars expend such large carbon emissions, this is a very environmentally friendly switch.

You make a great point about cities seeming not eco-friendly due to pollution and litter. I think of where I’m from: the San Francisco Bay Area, a city that is the last thing you would imagine to be environmentally friendly based on the trash in the streets, the amount of traffic, and the air pollution. As you suggest, initially, it’s difficult to understand how a city is more sustainable, but when it comes to city lifestyle, it definitely can be much more sustainable compared to living in a rural area that doesn’t have much around. If you live in a rural area you more than likely have to drive to get from point A to point B, but city life doesn’t require you to, in fact, it’s much simpler to take public transportation or even walk. Although a locale like Walden Pond seems all lush and green, it doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s an environmentally conscious way to live. Being in a loud bustling city is the way to go because smaller housing units are available and most places are accessible by means other than a car.

I completely agree. Growing up, I was taught that the great outdoors screamed "save the planet" and I attributed living in small, agricultural towns as the most green thing to do in terms of where a person could live. Little did I realize that the emissions from transportation of a person to get places within these spread out areas is immense, not to mention how many emissions the demand for food, clothes, products, etc. to reach these towns is so much higher than in cities. I think that this can tie back to the reading about communication from this week, as often times people attribute "eco-friendly" with the outdated or incorrect information many people grew up learning/observing. Another aspect of this lecture video I would like to mention is the idea of shared living in order to limit our emissions. As college students, we are currently experiencing the concept of shared living in dorms and shared houses in Isla Vista. Although it isn't ideal at all times, we also have experienced the positives of these shared living conditions and should be able to share that with those that neglect to see the benefits. It is our job to transmit this information about the benefits of shared living in terms of the environment to the rest of the community and to be advocates for the planet, and if moving to a city with roommates is the answer, count me in!
<br><hr>

I thought the same thing when I was watching this lecture. Whenever I think about Los Angeles or New York I think about the trash on the ground, crowded streets, and disgusting odors that cloud the subways. These are not ideas that that usually come to mind when thinking about an environmentally friendly area. However, after watching this lecture, I understood why cities were better for the environment than suburbs. More people walk instead of drive, and they live in smaller apartments that are close together  rather than giant houses spaced out on a street. There are more people in less space. 
             <br><br>
The fact that average American houses are 2500 square feet and traditional Japanese houses are 400 square feet on average was surprising to me as well. I knew that our houses were larger than most countries, but I did not realize how much bigger they were. It makes sense that our carbon footprints are so much higher than everyone else's. Our houses emit way more carbon due to the increased size. It also did not realize that 55 percent of the population lives in a city. When I think about the number of major cities in the world, I would not guess that over half of the population lives there. 
             <br><br>
I also did not realize that houses accounted for 32 percent of our carbon footprints. When people think about reducing their carbon footprints, they do not usually think about living in a smaller house. If housing causes such a high amount of carbon to be emitted, people should know more about it. We need to educate more people about this problem so that we can get people to move to smaller houses and bigger cities.

I love living in big cities- which might be weird, considering I attend a school that’s miles away from anything remotely fun, like concert venues (that artists I enjoy watching live actually visit), a variety of good, inexpensive, authentic restaurants, or like, even a decent boba shop. I consider myself to be pretty much adapted to the city scene, so taking the bus to Downtown SB or kicking it in Isla Vista and Goleta is cool and all, but it gets old after a while.

             <br><br>

I appreciate the simplicity of co-housing communities and micro-apartments. Take Japan’s capsule hotels as an example. Not only do spaces like these serve an immense purpose in lessening our carbon footprint, but they’ve also always seemed exciting to me. In addition to this, back home, my parents own a two-story house, but I don’t even think we touch half of the rooms. It’s a constant rotation between the kitchen, the living room, and then our respective bedrooms. I’ve always thought, “what’s the point of occupying such a large space if we don’t even make use of all of it?”

             <br><br>

As Ken mentioned in this lecture video, our homes are becoming larger by the decade, and 32% of our carbon footprint is derived from cooling and heating of our homes as well as other energy-related uses in the home. This is disappointing. All things considered, I think co-housing communities, moving to urban cities, and micro-apartments are a prime example of what we can do as individuals to prevent the climate crisis from worsening.

I too love living in big cities, considering that I am from Los Angeles, the switch from living in LA to SB was very different. I was so used to the fast life, seeing bright lights coming off of cars and buildings, tons of people walking up and down the street no matter the time of day, having everything nearby, to now living in a small Santa Barbarian town was quite a change that I'm not at all bothered with. I experienced the opposite of what you did, I have yet to get tired with this beautiful town. There are so many sights to see, places to explore, you just gotta get out there! I still think that I would love to live in a major city like Los Angeles when I am older, but not in the way LA is portrayed to be in the eyes of the hollywood lifestyle. I'm more of a simple gal, so the topic of living in micro apartments drew a lot of attention to me. Growing up I would always have conversations with my mom about how I pictured my life after school. I would mention to her how I imagined myself living with my friends in an apartment, all of us doing our own thing, having our own careers, but all living together. I never pictured myself living in a huge house, even if I were to have the money to afford it. So the idea of apartment living is very intriguing to me that I would love to take on. On the other hand, I don't think I would ever consider community living. Just the idea of sharing the same space with multiple families kind of bothers me. I can put up with a few people but definitely not with multiple families. But to those that wouldn't mind it, it would be great to see more co-housing communities considering that they are very beneficial in terms of our climate crisis.

It’s not surprising housing is such a big contributor to the climate crisis, with homes stretching as far as the eye can see in many places. A big associator with wealth is big houses, which feeds America’s obsession with materialistic goods and showing off their wealth. But, houses are one of the most detrimental ways to show off wealth, with the average house emitting 80m metric tons of carbon to be built. What’s even more worrying, is how these houses will keep on getting bigger and bigger as the economy grows and people get richer. The average house now is already more than a 1000 square feet than average houses before, and that number will likely continue growing with zero regards to the environment. To curb this growth would mean curbing America’s materialism and obsession for these goods that show off their wealth. 
              <br><br>
To make a big impact, almost everyone would need to move into cohousing and other eco- communities instead of living in these big houses by themselves. However, most people are very hesitant to do so with certain stigmas associated with these housing options. People flash their wealth and success by the houses they live in, cars they drive etc.. To create a healthier lifestyle for the planet, we would need to get rid of all that. Cohousing is definitely a good way to go for that. I personally wouldn’t mind it since I am terrible at cooking so maybe I’ll live there after college and save money, and the environment.

I was also not surprised when I learned that housing is a big contributor to the climate crisis and our own carbon footprints. I realized just how hard it is to notice that I am leaving a carbon footprint when I am enjoying the comforts of my own home. It is easy to forget that the electricity used in heating and cooling, lights, and almost everything in the house that requires power, is leaving a carbon footprint. Ken’s point about how the houses are growing in size is scary because I believe that everyone realizes that a big house doesn’t really have a function. Rich people are buying bigger houses because the economy has sold to us the idea that “bigger is better.” However, what ends up happening is that there is a bunch of empty and wasted space on the property. A mansion may have 3 living rooms, but realistically one is more than enough for a family. When you mentioned that we need to “curb America’s materialism and obsession” in order to stop the growth of houses I tried to think of how that would become a reality. This will require a complete shift in policies and an ideology that has been solidifying for hundreds of years. It will definitely be difficult but it is important to stay optimistic. 
              <br><br>
I also agree that eco-houses such as micro-apartments and cohousing communities can carry a stigma, but I also believe many people will be curious about it when they find out that you are living in an eco-house. This is an example of a good way to communicate the climate crisis. If people are curious as to why you chose to live in a micro-apartment, this could be a window for you to share about how much you care about the environment and how you’re contributing to mitigate the climate crisis. You wouldn’t have to convince people to move into a micro-apartment, but segway it into how they can reduce their electricity use or think about moving closer into the city. Personally, I am a pretty minimalistic person so I wouldn't mind living in a micro-apartment. A cohousing community sounds cool too and I would be open to try it out too. I thought Ken’s lecture on how cities are becoming more “green” was very interesting. When I hear the word city I think of dirty, polluted, and grey. Usually the color green is not a description I would use when I describe what I think a city typically looks like. I think it is really cool that environmental activists are taking nature into the city and turning it into a solution to cut down on one’s carbon footprint.

</span></div><hr>

<p>

I know Ken said that the solutions he would provide us with would make some of us pull back from giving up certain things and I am one of the people to not be on board with the solutions. I am not on board bc I think they aren’t helpful but because I personally don’t want to share restrooms and kitchens for my whole life. I grew up in a one bedroom apartment with 7 people and    a dog. Now I’m living with two people and sharing restrooms and kitchens with people who don’t entirely respect shared spaces. A lot of people that shared similar living situations have a dream of being able to make it in order to move out of the tiny spaces they’ve lived their whole lives and finally have space to call their own. While I’m definitely not saying I’m going to buy a large house that can be occupied by more than five people. Also on the topic about more people coming to cities is also concerning because Los Angeles has sidewalks filled with people in the streets. We have a lot of issues within our cities that I think we need to solve first before adding more to it. Expecting us to give up what we have never had while there are rich people that are the one actually doing the most damage is frustrating. I understand that Ken is being helpful, but I think it is important for him to acknowledge the privilege there is in making choices. For most of my life it was not a privilege or choice to live in a crowded apartment but a necessity.

There are a lot of hard choice to made about what people should do. Protect the environment, or live a more comfortable life? This is one of them. I suggest we put eco-friendliness in the first place, and then adjust our lifestyles. It doesn’t have to change completely, but it is necessary to make adjustment. For example, minimalism. We don’t have to be like Thoreau who lived in the wild and completely far away from other people. However, try not to spend a lot of money on housing. Redesign the house so that our daily life releases less carbon footprint. Also, big cities contain too much air pollutions, which make them places that are harmful to health and the Earth.

Living as a freshman in on campus dorms is the epitome of close-quarters. Although I was apprehensive at first, growing up an only child in a suburban home, I found that I actually don't mind it. Co-housing, similar to dorm life, doesn't seem so terrible. While the typical American mindset is to own your own property, have as many rooms as possible, and all these other property owning attributes, the one things that's unappealing about all that is the cost. In terms of maintenance, property taxes, insurance, and mortgages, it is so much money that can be directed towards other things in life. Buying a micro-apartment or living in a commune not only saves you money but allows you to reduce your carbon footprint in the process. This whole concepts of smaller housing and living in cities plays into the notion of minimalism. Living in the dorms, I have realized that there are so many things I can live without. Namely, I learned that I comfortably live with a 1/4 of the possessions I had at home and I didn't even realize it.
              <br><br>

Green spaces in cities such as New York started being formed in the 1800s with the help of reformist movements back in the day. With the environmental movement gaining traction, green spaces and rooftops gardens will only become more common with the push for sustainability. It's ironic that cities are seen as so dirty and crowded and yet they are greener than the suburbs. Considering the fact that only 1 in 5 people commute by car to work in Manhattan shows that although cities are high density and crowded, they allow for easier movement within the city itself. Ultimately, cities are easier places to live in if you want to be environmentally friendly.

I can relate to your experience. Although I’m not an only child, I had my own room in a nicely-sized suburban home, so I had a lot of space for myself. Transitioning from living in a house to a small triple dorm room took a little bit of time and compromise. Living in such close quarters with people I had just met was an interesting experience, but now I love my roommates and our quaint little dorm room. Sometimes it feels a bit cramped, but that definitely has to do with our accumulation of things. While I don’t mind living in a small space with other people, my parents are on a completely different page. They’ve worked their whole lives to achieve something adjacent to the American Dream: building themselves up from the bottom, having a family, being able to afford a large and comfortable home. It would be incredibly hard to convince them to forgo their house for an apartment, even after they’ve become empty nesters. I think that’s the case for a lot of people our parents’ age. In my mind, it could be more effective to focus on marketing scaled-down living to those who are younger and have not bought a house yet. 

              <br><br>

It makes me optimistic seeing all of the measures that cities are taking to promote green living. Normalizing commuting via public transportation or biking, rooftop gardens, minimalism practices, and overall sustainable living is essential to furthering climate change action. My aunt lives in Portland and she’s taken incredible steps to becoming more sustainable in her home. She has her own composting boxes, a chicken coop, and a garden that not only grows beautiful plants and flowers, but also ingredients that can be used in the kitchen. I strive to be like her one day, being conscious of even simple actions that I can take to help the environment.

It is wild to me that the amount of children we are having is decreasing but the size of our house is increasing? Logically speaking, if the amount of people living in the house goes down then so should the size, yet we are doing the opposite. The era of the McMansion is really troubling to me because there is so much unnecessary space in the house that often goes unused by the owner. Just think of all the billionaires who have whole estates for two people! I don't know if it's because I spent the majority of my life sharing rooms, but I don't think we need giant spaces to be happy. A home should be a comforting place not a huge luxurious thing. 
              <br><br>
I actually think it would be really cool to live in a tiny apartment. Living a dorm has shown me how little I actually need to perform my daily activities. These apartments would be cheaper because of the size, and since they are in the city, they will limit your car use. Another added bonus of having a smaller space is that it will also make you less likely to buy unnecessary junk you don't need. I really hope other major cities implement micro-apartments because it will be an easy way for someone to help the environment, and trust me when I say that most people don't make personal changes because they think it's too hard so giving simple and easy options will incentivize people to do it. 
              <br><br>

The concept of a community home is really interesting to me. Again, this goes back into a community working together and helping one another. The cooking, cleaning, and other duties would all be shared amongst the people and I think everyone desires to have that sense of belonging that a community home could bring. In my ideal world, I would live in one as an adult with my sisters and parents where each of us is in reach.

In agreement with the following comment, the same thought came into my head as well when watching this lecture video. It is truly confusing about the fact that the number of children families are having is decreasing while the sizes of houses that families are buying is increasing, it simply does not make sense.  Many people today are stuck on what most people believe in and go by which is that the, “bigger the better.” When having a home or place of your own it does not really need to consist of much to make it feel like a like place of your own that you can call home and be comfortable in. I think there is definitely a point where these houses that are becoming more common are excessively bigger than they need to be and most of the time it's just useless space, like does a house really need three extra rooms, for things such as a game room or a movie theater that these billionaires all make sure to include in their homes. 
              <br><br>

I feel as though in a way I can slowly see many city planners and businesses making more small tight apartments in inner-city places, but of course not enough. In many busy cities and downtown areas is where you see most apartments and condos because that is what most young people attract to. So in this case, I feel like it may be hard to fully transform to a communal setting of apartments or houses, just because I feel like that's why many people move out or decide to want to live on their own because they want to be away from people and on their by themselves and have their personal space.  However, it may be worth the try as some people may be open to it and if they can get it to cost less I’m sure it would attract many more people since the cost of living is constantly increasing.

Hearing ken talk about new styles of living like micro apartments in cities really reminds me of the older movies that portrayed the future in such a way. While they might have done it to show some sort of futuristic dystopia, it almost seems inevitable once climate change forces us to change our living conditions. Instead of expanding outwards onto new lands, we will instead expand vertically, building higher and higher buildings to effectively house larger numbers of our population. Cities like Santa Barbara and IV which may not be considered traditional cities like New York or Chicago in terms of landscape, will eventually grow its building vertically, being 4,5,6+ stories high. As someone who has grew up in the epitome of suburbia, south OC, I was always envious of the city living that residents of New York or Seattle or even Boson could experience. The idea of knowing all your neighbors with close proximity, having history to where you grew up, being able to really become a part of a bigger culture and rep your city was and still is a great dream of mine. I think that when you don’t have the most ideal situations like huge houses and lavish lifestyles, you are more related to those around you, with a commonality of “the struggle” that actually makes you closer to people that you would ever imagine. I definitely am intrigued by the idea of a micro apartment or  some sort of environmental living, especially since I’m a believer that it’s the people around you, not the place where you live, that make your experience. I think it’s definitely the future of what we expect from housing, whether we chose to embrace it or not.

Yeah, I totally agree, when he described the tiny futuristic houses, I immediately thought of Ready Player One and the vertical building and conservation of space. It seems like a future that we may need to start moving towards because 32% of our carbon footprint comes from our homes. After the last few weeks being devoted to how our food production leads to methane and other greenhouse gasses as well as using exorbitant amounts of resources to procure, I thought it was imperative to adopt a lifestyle that reduces our individual footprint via consuming less meat products. However, I neglected to take into account the potential damage caused by housing. The hegemony associated with position of large estates is perpetuated by a society so focused on consumer culture, that environmental repercussions of our actions aren’t considered preeminent. One problem I have with the idea of building tiny houses and normalizing them, is that in order for this to be successful, we must first build them and see a desire to live there. Without the support of the consumers, the demand will lead to empty buildings and wasted real estate. Only once there is a desire for these tiny houses among the city dwellers will the production of said units be feasible.


<br><hr>
I would have to agree that the future in which I’ve commonly envisioned includes building upward and in less space when it comes to housing. All illustrations of the ‘future’ commonly include smaller dwellings areas in cities, in contrast to the large homes we have become so accustomed to. With regard to growing up in a predominately suburban area, the most common way to travel back home was by car. . In the Coachella Valley, which travelers tend to enjoy for the lower priced homes, for bigger pieces of real estate, the idea of smaller homes would be a great shock to many residents of the valley. While this isn’t necessarily a bad thing, those seeking destination homes in the area are often looking to purchase larger estates to retain as vacation homes. As a result, bigger and more expensive homes are built in order to fulfill these wishes. The idea of ‘tiny homes’ have appeared in the valley, although predominantly viewed as a solution aiding homeless individuals. This small vantage point paints this PS proposal as a solution to only this particular group of people, rather than the individuals at large. Within my experience with campus housing alone, I’ve come to alter my own viewpoints on housing for each individual/family, and come to appreciate the communication and connections provided by this smaller living area. A point of improvement could very well be in addressing privacy (with regard to communal bathrooms) and other facilities (as they’ve been working on), but appears promising with the idea of large scale micro housing.

I think the most realistic prospects Ken proposed were moving to cities, living in small apartments, and increasing greenspace within cities. People of our generation want to enjoy life and have easy access to amenities such as parks, clubs, bars, shopping, etc. that cities offer all in a close proximity. I think young people will want to spend less money on rent for a huge apartment and more on food and fun. In addition, I get the sense that people are becoming less inclined to have kids, meaning they will not require a massive suburban house to live comfortably. As for greenspace, I think urban farming and urban forestry is quite interesting. City planners should begin to look at how they can maximize greenspace within cities through things such as rooftop gardens, parks, and community land plots. As for communal living, I don't think this will catch on. People today are very used to having their alone time and private space, and this is hard to come by in a communal setting. I don't think people like other people enough to live in communes on a large scale.

Before taking this class, I regard the big house, luxury car, and expensive stuff as the signal of success, just like many others do. However, now I am ashamed for such belife because owning too much does show that you earn a high salary and are successful in your career to others, but it also reflects that you do not care about the environment. It is selfish to only think about oneself and satisfy every desire you have. In the long run, protecting the environment provides much more joy than consuming. Thus, I decide to change my future plan. For example, I won't buy a car unless I really need it to get to work. Besides, I will choose to buy a house with a small size, which is enough for one or two people to live in. I also notice that people are less willing to have a child, which will certainly reduce CO2 emissions. Moreover, I plan to introduce such kind of lifestyle to my parents and family, because their generation still holds many old ideas.


<br><hr>
I fully agree with the statements above. Even with all of the environmental movements and individual documentaries motivating more people to switch to a sustainable lifestyle every day, there are still many people who would not cooperate with such drastic changes. Moving to smaller apartments seems like one of the easiest solutions and most logical solutions to implement. Smaller houses mean less rent to pay and also a more fulfilling living space. I remember that in one of Ken's assignments there was a selection of people that lived in tiny houses that were interviewed as to how a smaller living space impacted their lives. One of the most prominent arguments is that normal Americans don't even use all of the living space in their house. Thermal sensor imaging detailed the location of different families as they went about their day and found that many people living in large houses did not even use half of their living space. People living in smaller houses in the documentary highlighted how they felt like every part of their house has a purpose and has become more fulfilling to maintain. By keeping it simple and cheap, these people can live happy and fulfilling lifestyles all the while helping reduce the global emission of greenhouse gases. I also agree with Jordan that communal living will prevent people from enjoying their time alone so I don't think it will become a reliable solution. Since people have different living habits, communal living might also lead to conflicts with such habits in between people. To conclude, I think reducing our living space is one of the more easy solutions to climate change to implement with everyone's interests at heart.

<br><hr>
Hey, just wanted to start off by saying that I completely agree with your first statement saying that the proposal Ken made was most realistic relative to most of the solutions we’ve heard from previous lectures. These solutions involved tackling the problem with housing and transportation. As Ken said, 32% of the average American’s carbon footprint comes from their homes, and 28% comes from transportation. While this might sound bad, Ken proposed a way that we can take to approach the housing and transportation issues, which was to move to the city. From the statistics that Ken stated, it’s clear to see why this is a great solution and step in the right direction. Ken stated that 1 in 5 people in Manhattan go to work by car, meaning 80% of the population either takes public transportation, walks, bikes, etc (i.e., all the other ways that decrease carbon emissions dramatically.

I agree with your claim that people of our generation want to enjoy life and have easy access to amenities, such as parks, bars, stores, that would all be in close proximity. Now that society has been increasingly getting more educated, we’re starting to be less inclined to have children as you said, which is really beneficial for the sake of our planet. Not only does this not add another human to exploitation of fossil fuels, but also families will no longer be inclined to buy bigger homes/apartments as you said. People will hopefully move to smaller places such as micro apartments or co-housing communities. 
               <br><br>

When it came to communal housing, you did make a valid point about it catching on. I agree it probably won’t, but for the people that would be okay with it (i.e., the people that do like other people), I highly condone they do so, because not only would it be good for the environment, I believe it would be good for the mental well-being and make them happier in general.

<br><hr>
I also agree with the following comment and believe that most young people, who are in college or just getting out of college will tend to attract more to the busy city atmosphere, that consists of the small living with buildings such as apartment and condos. This group of people that I mentioned are looking for that busy atmosphere, that contains so so much entertainment and different things to do in such all small space and they could live minutes from all of that exposure. However, I do not think families that are ready to settle down will want that atmosphere. They would rather have a house of their own most likely in a neighborhood that is less crowded, more intimate, and quiet. However, I do not think either the younger group or families will being in favor of communal living. Most people move out and want places of their own and want that personal space and would rather have a place of their own that they do not have to worry about sharing or making it a specific way because it is theirs. The only possible way I can see some people be I favor of this idea is that it is the economically best option, but other than that I can not see this idea of a communal living developing into something big.

To have people motivated to move to cities instead of their current suburban home will be extremely difficult. Changes like diet and transportation seem more feasible than packing up all of your stuff. Moving to a city seems to only feasible if one is to work and/or spend significant time there. I also have to acknowledge that I would like to live in a suburban area. I never grew up in a large city, so I have not had the experience of living in one, despite the numerous ways it could help the planet. I enjoy the quiet of the suburbs,  the open space, privacy, and so much more. As houses are becoming larger, the amount of carbon dioxide emitted is also increasing, so a possible compromise could be to buy a smaller house in a suburban area. My hope is that would make a difference, even if it's a small one. Additionally, as I would most likely be walking in a city to get to places, I could do what I am doing now, and bike in the suburbs to get to my destinations. Living in a city seems to be too big of an adjustment for my personality, but making small changes, such as the ones discussed throughout this quarter, seems more practical.
                <br><br>

A more meaningful change for me to make is to change my addiction to stuff, especially large stuff. Seeing how as a kid I spent a few years in an extremely small apartment with three other people, and with my family eventually sizing up to a single family home, I question if sizing up was truly necessary. Yes, the apartment was tiny, but from what I remember it was spacious enough for my brother and I to share a room and it had all the amenities a “normal” apartment would have. Sizing up to the single family home provided my family with a lot more space. There was a large backyard with a variety of fruits and vegetables planted as well as four bedrooms and four baths. Yes, the space was wonderful, but many of the rooms went untouched, only used as storage for all of the accumulated stuff. I obviously didn’t have control as to where I lived as a child, but that experience is shaping how I want to live in the future. I do not want a large house, so instead of moving to a city, opting for a small home would be a better alternative.

Growing up in the suburbs outside of Oakland, with a 30-minute commute to San Francisco, I have always loved the idea of living in a city. This surprises many of my friends and family members because they still hold on to the perception of cities being dirty and polluted. I love cities because of the hustle and bustle, diversity, sense of greater belonging, and the environmental benefits don't hurt either. Cities are great because of how walkable they often are and the immense sharing economy that they come with. In my experiences in San Franciso, there are tons of "Buy Nothing" Facebook groups where people trade or simply give away items they no longer find useful. There are also often lots of quality items that are left on the street for people to take for free. This aspect of a city is amazing. I also love cities, especially European ones like Amsterdam because of how walkable they are and how there are fewer cars around. In the US this is not as much of a reality, but I feel as if policy will lean towards car-free cities.
                <br><br>


However, I do find it hard to find cities feasible to live in given the extreme cost of housing there and as Ken mentioned, growing demand for more housing. Living in the Bay Area, housing prices are already realistic and I can't imagine how much higher they will go in the next 30 years. I believe this issue will need to be tackled before cities will be able to become a viable housing option for many. 
                <br><br>
With co-housing or cooperative living, I think that it is totally feasible using houses that already exist in the suburbs. Programs like Cool Block push this kind of interdependency among neighbors, helping people transition to full co-housing lifestyles. I think co-housing is more feasible for the elderly and people with children because it benefits both parties a lot and is great for children to grow up in. Tiny apartments in my mind are hard for children because of the extremely close quarters and lack of at least some privacy as they mature.

I totally agree and relate with you. I also grew up in the suburbs far from any city and I rarely ever visited them either. I admit I love the idea of cities and how close it is to everything and the few times I did visit cities such as San Francisco or Berkeley I really did love how I could just walk wherever I wanted to go. However, like you said living in cities is extremely expensive. My sister lived in Berkeley for four years when she went to University there and I remember her living with multiple housemates as well as roommates and the rent was still incredibly high and had to work various jobs to afford it while still being a full time student. So I definitely agree with you that the cost of living would need to change in order for more people to be able to live in cities.

For a long time, ever since I was a kid, I always thought of cities in the way they are often portrayed, being dirty, polluting and trash filled environmental nightmares.  It seems like it makes sense, when we visit cities there is little greenery, masses of people everywhere and it really seems like a place where humanity has squashed nature for their own benefit.  Of course that is true to some extent, there had to have been natural wilderness there before any city was going to be built, but overall I now recognize what I misconception that was.  I distinctly remember a few years ago watching a random short you tube video, simply explaining how largely due to transportation pollution cities were much more eco friendly to live in.  It got me to think about exactly why I thought a city was so much worse for the planet, and the more I considered many of the things Ken talked about in this video the more I came to realize how much more efficient they are.  They pack so many people into the smallest space possible, cut down transportation lengths for everyone making public transport more efficient, and just generally are a much more efficient use of space.  I came around very quickly to the idea of living in a city, it just seems like the most logically path for our culture to take.  Not only will it be way better for the environment, but it is frankly a change I want to make.  I think it would be great living right where the action is, being around so many people and getting to experience a collective lifestyle of sorts.  I would love it if I could get everywhere I needed to go just by walking or biking, which in a city would be fairly easy but living out in the suburbs takes dedication if it's is even feasible.  And I can only assume it would be less expensive than living out in a big house, paying greater property tax and having to buy gasoline all the time just to get to work or the grocery store every day.  It isn't like I have to give up nature either, occasional camping trips outside of the city would be more than enough for me to appreciate nature in my life and come back to my city home renewed.  Above all I would absolutely hate to have to commute hours every day to work in traffic, time that could have been spent on any number of things I rather would have been doing.  Overall this is one of the cultural changes the climate crisis will force us to make that I am personally the most excited for, and ready to embrace.

From what you described, that’s definitely the stereotypical image of a city. Overcrowded, alleys filled with trash, air pollution caused by transportation, etc. However, the city is bigger than we think. The only reason why we only see the bad side is because that’s where all the tourists congregate. A real city-dweller will know how to avoid that mess and find their simpler way of life. Of course, a city cannot function without revenue, hence all the tourists from all over the world (I’m talking about Manhattan here). In contrast, I’ve noticed that in the cities of Santa Barbara and Santa Monica in LA, the public transportation has transformed into zero emission. These blue/green buses have taken over and I cannot be happier. Being a driver (I feel so guilty saying this), it makes me feel so much better and healthier to be on the road because these huge buses won’t have to release any black smoke anymore. This change needs to take place elsewhere as well. The only reason why I’ve only seen them in SB and SM was probably because these cities have the financial means to redesign their public transportation. Our government needs to invest more in this area to improve other areas as well. I think a great place to start is the school buses for those who rely on them on a daily basis. If you set a good example for kids, it might also be a good opportunity for them to learn. On the other hand, the only persuasive way to convince more people to move to cities like Manhattan is to lower its housing price. I’m moving to New York in June and I’m stressed about my rent. Paying $2000 for a one-bedroom is common there. I wish there are more co-housing opportunities in the US. That will be a fun way for me to make new friends and also just save more money in general.

I would love for reality to reflect the vision in my head when Ken Hiltner explained integrating the environment with city life. White (white is a lovely color but they're also good for insulation purposes when considering the interaction with electromagnetic waves) apartment buildings with various plants and gardens neatly integrated in each home. I'm certain that a city living doesn't necessarily have to be inside a giant boring rectangular prism; I imagine some modern architecture could do wonders to make city living appear more attractive and suggest a more happy experience living there. Of course, this would require a bit more maintenance for the apartment and the assumption that everyone would be able to adjust into being upstanding citizens. Perhaps a minor fear of mine is a loss of individualism.
                <br><br>

I feel that co-living has been, fortunately, a very positive experience for me as a Santa Barbara/Goleta resident and would be happy to continue this practice if at all possible.

<br><hr>
I definitely agree that a move to the city is the most logical path for our culture to take. It just makes sense. Not only will it be cheaper, but it will be vastly more efficient than taking the freeway every morning coming from an overpriced, oversized home in the suburbs. Public transportation, a bike, and your own two feet are all you need to get around. However, I do believe that public transportation needs to be revamped or updated. Taking a bus has become undesirable in today's culture and as a result, that sector definitely needs more funding if we need to convince people of the benefits of public transportation.

<br><hr>
Your description of cities is definitely one that I shared. I grew up in a small suburb, with access to open nature and green pastures close by. I used to think that cities represented pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and fast-paced, difficult lifestyles. However, I have come to realize that city life is the more environmentally friendly option for people to take. In my mind, cities have always been somewhat dirty and unappealing, when in reality they are brimming with eco-efficiency. From the small living spaces, to the accessible and plentiful public transportation, there is not much more someone could ask for. These aspects are major drawing points for me, and I hope that as I get older I am more drawn to the idea of a fast-paced city life, so that I can reduce my carbon footprint. Something Ken mentioned in this video that I found interesting is the idea of co-housing, which would entail sharing communal spaces such as kitchens. This seems like it would be a bit of a culture shock at first, especially because something like this is atypical to the United States, but I also feel that it would be a great way to connect with your community and neighbors. Ken mentioned that people who live in co-housing tend to eat more communal meals together, and for this reason I see co-housing as a great opportunity to unite people.

<br><hr>
I certainly am wary about living in cities for that exact reason. I'm not a fan of crowds and my ideal living situation has been small towns in mostly rural areas. I don't want to be far away from nature. However, if we can build communities in cities, and bring nature there, it's really not that bad at all. If we grow gardens and raise chickens and advocate for parks and bike paths and public transportation, that actually sounds pretty utopian. Although, if I had the choice between a micro-apartment in the city and communal housing in a suburban area, I would probably take the communal housing. I feel like, despite the proximity you have to your neighbors in a city, you don't build connections. And connections are pretty vital for a happy life. Plus micro-apartments have to be owned and run by landlords which are often not great people which lead to not great experiences. I see more hope in small communities cultivating the land around them than I do in cities. But perhaps I'm just a romantic and could do with some realism. There is also the fact that I don't feel safe in cities, and getting over that hurdle is fairly difficult.
<br><hr>
I agree, growing up I viewed the city as dirty and scary. While cities are not as bad as I viewed them before, they're still not favorable. I would love to live in a city one day and be able to walk or bike where ever I needed to go, but I wish governments would invest more money in developing cities to make them eco friendly and nice. Where I'm from downtown has a large homeless population and there's certain areas that aren't safe to walk alone at night. Additionally, there's only one park downtown which is all the nature it has. Therefore I like the idea of introducing the environment to the cities. One idea I particularly like is the rooftop gardens. Having a green roof has been a dream of mine for years now, and being able to have one while living in the city would be ideal.

This topic shocked me. I always thought of cities too many buildings and streets crowded with cars. Basically, all concrete and no greenery. I thought of suburbs, on the other hand, as spread out houses with grass lawns and tree lined sidewalks. Just because I saw more plants in suburbs than cities, I guess I thought that made me think of it as a more environmental way of living. It was interesting to learn that the opposite is true. Because suburbs are so spread out they take up much more space per person, and because the houses are larger they use more energy per person. However, small apartments in cities use less space and energy per person. This makes living in a city like Manhattan more environmentally friendly than living in Wyoming. Crazy! But also super cool! The idea of a “green metropolis” with people starting things like rooftop gardens sounds so intriguing to me! I agree with the idea that we already have these places developed so we need to nurture them as much as we can before moving out into more land. 
                <br><br>


I am definitely now more likely to live in a city after college. I am also interested in the micro-apartments mentioned here. There are now so many TV shows about living in tiny houses that it has become trendy, which is a good thing! I think that micro-apartments are a great way to live in a tiny space in cities as well. After living in the dorms freshman year, I realized that I like living in a smaller space because it forces me to live with things that I only really need or love, rather than filling my home with lots of random stuff. I would like to continue living in this way after college in a small city apartment.

I found myself in the same shock as you after watching Ken’s video. When I visited UCLA this past weekend, I was disappointed to be unable to see the stars I was so used to seeing at night. Instead, a haze covered the city, smoke billowed out from buildings, and the lights of the city made it impossible to see the night sky. How could a city like LA be more environmentally friendly than suburban areas or an area like Santa Barbara? 
                <br><br>


At first it was difficult to wrap my head around, but just as you discovered, I realized that it made complete sense. Smaller living spaces in cities versus large homes with lots of unused space. Prevalent and easily accessible public transportation versus a car for each family member. So much energy and carbon emissions could be saved from these kinds of lifestyles.

                <br><br>

I think you also made a good point when you noted that micro-apartments would force you to have less belongings. That would take care of two problems at once—expending less carbon emissions by living in an apartment and reducing the amount of unnecessary stuff in your home. Additionally, living in an urban area would encourage more bus/subway/train use than living in a suburban area would. Other than air/light pollution, the idea sounds pretty appealing. It’s also definitely important that more people are aware of this and do not have the misconception that so many people had around Thoreau’s time, when cities were seen as environmental nightmares instead of environmentally friendly.

<br><hr>
Growing up I always had the idea that cities were actually bad for our environment because of how populated they are. I expected cities to be bad just because of the amount of pollution produced by so many people living there. I grew up living at the port of Los Angeles and the amount of air pollution and trash you would see would make you think city living can not be good for our environment. I was also shocked to learn that it's actually the complete opposite and actually better for our environment if you live in cities. 
                <br><br>

I think city living is beneficial for the environment because of easier access to things such as public transportation and smaller spaces have less of a carbon footprint. As you mentioned, living at college has made it more enticing to live in smaller spaces because it allows you to think about what I actually need. Living in an apartment in IV, I am more selective about what I really need and have fewer things. Smaller spaces have made it easier to live a minimalist lifestyle. I have also been able to apply that same mindset at home and decrease the amount of spending I do especially when it comes to useless products. 
                <br><br>

I also see tiny apartments have become a trend! I love watching those shows on HGTV and they can be really inspiring when it comes to how you can live your own life. Not only are occupying a smaller space and able to limit the amount of energy you use, but it also encourages you to not to have that much stuff. Those shows are really fascinating to watch and I am glad to see more and more people are participating in living in micro-apartments or tiny homes.
<br><hr>

I agree with your preference of living small to encourage minimalism. Knowing the effects that living in suburbia can have on perpetuating the climate crisis is frustrating, but makes total sense. Driving everywhere, to work, to the store, or to a friend's pumps unnecessary emissions into the atmosphere because the town is so spread out. I come from a suburb and this is exactly how it is, but there really is no other choice--besides carpooling. It's crazy to me how much time I spent in a car back then, as well as the emissions I caused. It was daily life; my parents had their own cars and do the same thing! Going home now, I feel guilty driving so much. I'm grateful to live in IV where everything is only a few blocks or a bus ride away. Now that I've gotten used to relying on public transportation, I've come to realize that it's quite efficient, and there's no worry about parking. 
                <br><br>
Going back to housing, it's appealing to have a small space because I'm aware of all the items that I have. There's no clutter. It does feel a bit tight, but that aspect encourages me to get out more and find new nooks on campus. I definitely think that I can live in a city long term because of the minimalism that is, in a way, forced upon me and encourages me to consider my purchases and the value of my belongings. I truly have what I need, and it's enough. Maybe when I settle down I'll want a place that's a bit larger; however, a city is the place to be. Everything seems to be more accessible.


<br><hr>

I completely agree with your thoughts watching this video! I think you bring up a great point about living in a smaller space with the dorms in freshman year. Essentially, being forced into that smaller space pushes you to reevaluate the way you live and can even help your pursuit of lifestyles like minimalism. It goes to show that having the infrastructure in place is so necessary to support people if they strive for behavioral change that will combat the climate crisis. 
                <br><br>

At the same time however, that brings up issues that we discussed previously with minimalism. Living small can often be seen as environmentally friendly, but often people simply are forced to for socioeconomic reasons. Ultimately I feel though that the idea of micro-apartments and co-housing communities is a great way to rethink the way we share resources and co-exist harmoniously. I too, always imagine big cities when I think of major pollution and terrible environmental practices. But living more tightly compacted, sharing more resources, and limiting your stuff and consumption, you’re doing your part in altering the way we plop ourselves on this land. Americans long had the idea of Manifest Destiny and the American Dream where we could conquer the entire land and have big houses, but today that just doesn’t meet our needs and align with the solutions to combat the climate crisis. I like that cities are compacted so that we can leave the rest of the outside rural world alone to be.

<br><hr>
I was also surprised to hear that cities are more environmentally friendly. When I think of cities, I think of New York City. At night, in NYC, there are so many trash bags scattered across the streets, so I think this made me think that they are less environmentally friendly. Also the fact that they have less trees, like you mentioned. When thinking about it in terms of the amount of CO2 emissions released to build a typical house (80 metric tons), I can understand why the suburbs would be less environmentally friendly. There are also activists bringing nature to cities now through rooftop gardens, which might make the city look more like nature. I think this would make cities look more beautiful and more welcoming. 
                <br><br>
I was always against moving to a city because when I think of cities, I see a dirty and unwelcoming place, but I think if I moved to a less population dense city, I would really enjoy it. I also think that a micro-apartment would be really nice. When I first walked into my dorm, I was shook and didn’t want to live there, considering the small space that was provided for three people. Surprisingly, I'm actually enjoying it. Simplicity could help make the rest of your life easier to handle. Thanks for your response.

Though I’ve been exposed to this topic about housing during the start of the class, I’m still not getting bored of this topic. Actually, I found something more intriguing--cities and the new activism about green metropolises. If only restrained on the level of housing, cities may be a good choice cuz the economic pressure and land use have made owning a large house in the center of NY (or these kinds of supercenters) impossible. And in order to minimize the cost of housing, occupants will naturally favor the cheaper apartments and co-housing programs, which in turn feeds the need of environmental activism. It is understandable to deduce based on my limited knowledge. But when trying to extend to larger fields, like agriculture and grazing, the lecture and the theories are opening my eyes. I just can’t imagine cows and sheep grazing around swimming pools, or a vegetable yard suddenly appearing in the center of the city. Thus, what I’ve learned today is, though counterintuitive, interestingly practical. I hope to discover more ways in today’s theory of environmental activism and even try out something immediate.

I also think that green metropolises are very interesting, too. Like when you think of cities the first thing that pops up is like pollution and traffic,  but in reality, it is just more green than ten thousand suburban houses, each about 2500 sqt ft only supporting a small family. The efficiency of cities is unreachable. I think for agriculture, it is a different story. If we want better efficiency, we can't have large farmlands to raise cattle, which would defeat the whole purpose of living efficiently. I think what Ken was trying to say is that you can grow your own sustainable food source (locally grown, doesn't have to waste gas on transportations), and live as a community to help that little garden and eat the food together, which would also be a good bonding experience. And if we really think about it, if the purpose of this movement is to go green, why would we even need to raise cows or sheep?


<br><hr>
I totally agree with you--I think the economic incentive of having more co-housing and micro-apartments may be more appealing to a lot of people. Something I thought about while watching the lecture is how these things present a good opportunity to combat houselessness, as well as drastically improce our mass transportation systems. I think co-housing in cities may be very beneficial to uplifting folks who experience houselessness because it would probably be a lot cheaper to live with others and be able to share amenities and services with their community. Moreover, if and when the Green New Deal is implemented, there will a lot more jobs on the market and that could also possibly contribute to combatting houselessness. 
                <br><br>
I also agree with you that learning about urban farming sounds counterintuitive, but could actually really work. I was particularly intrigued when Ken talked about "bringing nature back to the city." I feel like greening more cities and creating things like community gardens could prove to be beneficial in bridging the disconnect many, many people have with nature (as well as tackle issues like food insecurity!) I think that many demographics besides white people usually don't have a close relationship/appreciation of nature because there are usually a lot of barriers to it (not enough time, don't know where to start, not enough money, etc). I'd argue that a disconnect with nature is also a reason why some people don't feel elicited to take climate action--it's an abstract concept. (I hope this makes sense). So, greening cities would definitely help bridge that disconnect and hopefully create a more close relationship to nature for a lot of people that may inspire them to take further action.

Growing up I constantly heard adults around me talking of their houses and how they wished they could have bigger or another house or extra rooms, things that genuinely are not necessary. Growing up around those adults I too have grown up with expectations for things within my future house, loving a wrap around porch, two-stories, a jacuzzi, etc my mentality does not help the crisis we are facing due to housing. I was aware that housing size has grown over the years and I believe the American ideas of bigger is better has led to the greed one has when it comes to their possessions. While I have always wanted a nicer house with the expectations I mentioned above, I do not actually "expect" to have a house like that. I understand that big houses are not reasonable nor are they practical, like come on, celebrities do not need mansions with 29 rooms if they live with their significant other and one child, what is the need? It has always angered me how vast, expensive, unreasonable, and taunting the houses of celebrities and the wealthy can be as I too have never understood the need for all of that space. For me it has always been a jealous anger that made me feel that way but as I have been more educated on the topic of the climate crisis I have become angered not out of jealousy, but out of shock for the disregard they have for the earth. While not all celebrities are greedy and have houses big enough to fit family upon family upon family, the majority of people with money have maintain the glamorous and luxurious lifestyle that has lasted for centuries, something that needs to change if we want to help the world at all.
                <br><br>

Addressing Ken's idea of co-housing and living in the city and how I feel about it, well, I'm not too sure. I understand that people cannot live the bigger is better lifestyle but I do not think I would want to share my space with a vast majority of people at a constant basis. I grew up in LA and having lived there for 18 years I grew an almost hatred for the city. I understand why people have moved to rural areas from cities as it helps them escape the traffic, the people, the sickness, the crime and all other aspects that come with city living. While I understand why living in a city would benefit the world and would make one's lifestyle easier, I do not think I could live in a city full of traffic and full of a vast amount of people constantly bustling around me. Sadly, I would love to assist the world by living in the city and living in a community with co-housing as a way to decrease my carbon footprint but I cannot. I know that as years go on people will move to cities more and hopefully that will help the climate but as far as how I personally feel I know that I would not be able to live in a big city and be happy, even if I meditate.

I quite agree with you. The change in rich people's lifestyles can reduce environmental pollution to a great extent. Rich people often have huge houses, dozens of cars and many children, which greatly increases carbon emissions. But the rich often have very high power and connections. Whether they can change their minds is still unknown.
                <br><br>
For your second paragraph, I appreciate that you say "but I cannot" bravely. I read a lot of other people's comments about how good this idea is to move to the city. It's awesome that you can show your thinking bravely, even though you may be criticized by others. It takes courage. In fact, no matter what it is to avoid, not willing to move to the city is a word in general, selfish. The rich people own mansions with 29 rooms to enjoy the admiration of others. It’s all about living comfortably, regardless of how the environment is damaged, in other words, selfish. So, I admire the courage of you to write such a comment.

This is a very interesting perspective. I grew up in a large house and the adults in my life all valued the same things, like the bigger/the more things the better, yet I never got into this idea and have always wanted to live in a city when I'm older. I feel like a lot of people agree with me in that I have heard a lot of people talking about wanting to live in a city when I ask where they want to be when they're older. Maybe this is confirmation bias, so it is good to see your comment. I wonder though, when the Boomer generation was our age, were they all wanting to live in cities in their 20s-early 30s and then move into suburbs, and will we follow that same path if that is true? As much as I hope, for the planet's sake, that a lot of our generation fall in love with city life and choose to continue living in cities for life, I feel like at some age most of us who say we want to live in cities will revert to older generations way of thinking and move into suburbs.
                <br><br>


I also totally agree that wealthy peoples mansions are insanely unnecessary and they definitely don't even use all their rooms, and while it looks glamorous, I'm sure many people see through that and see how wasteful they are. I really hope that the number of people choosing to live in mansions shrinks over our lifetime.
                <br><br>


I'm glad you are honest about not wanting at all to live in a city. Like Ken said in the video, not everyone will have to live in cities, so that's good. However, I don't think you should base your entire opinion on city living around LA -- a city notorious for its traffic and pollution. Also, there are smaller cities that are still better than owning a large house in the suburbs that might be more to your liking.
<br><hr>

I feel the same way. Coming from an affluent area of Orange County, I have often walked into friends or schoolmates massive houses and looked around wondering, "is all of this really neccesary." The truth is that we grow up learning to idolize celebrities with tons of money and property. This is both unrealistic and unsustainable. I believe we can truly aim to reduce house size for all wealthy Americans. However, like you said, co-housing just doesn't seem realistic. I myself would not enjoy being in such close proximity to others, and I imagine others echo my sentiment. I have never lived in a city, and honestly I never want to. It feels too busy and crazy for me, and if more people move there, it will just get worse and worse. I think we should look for more realistic solutions when approaching this issue.

<br><hr>
totally agree with your point here. First thing that came to my mind while watching this was the fact that celebrities own gigantic homes that they don't even need. I find this fact the most ridiculous. The only reason that they own these homes is because that's what society has created the image of being g successful too look like. In reality, their homes serve little practicality to them and its merely just an image thing. Like you mentioned, how much of the house are they even going to use. I remember an interview of Kim K saying she has never even used her pool outside her house. I have more respect for those who buy what they actually use, therefore, people in suburbs are a little more understandable as they are trying to find a nice reasonable place for their family. I always found it interesting to live in an apartment in the city. I love the idea of New York City for example over LA. Growing up in LA suburbs, we have to drive to most places versus living in NYC where you exit your apartment building and walk/take the subway to your destination. To me personally I find that very intriguing and definitely a housing plan I would love to consider in the future.
<br><hr>
I too have always envisioned myself as moving into a nice house in the suburbs to raise a family one day. I think that this is a prime example of the perpetuation of achieving the "American Dream" that is just continuously passed down through generations. For me, it's hard to distinguish whether I want this kind of house and life because it's been ingrained into my subconscious that a big house is an example of success, or if it's just pure desire. As a young adult right now, I am eager to live in a big city and therefore live a more sustainable life in as many ways as I can. However, while I still want to live a sustainable life when I have a family, and teach my children sustainable practices as well, for some reason, it's harder to picture raising a family in an apartment in the city  and being completely content than it is to picture myself living in one in just a few years.

<br><hr>
I was intrigued by the point that you made regarding adults constantly discussing the desire for a larger or more glamorous home. I can recall from a young age that my mom was dissatisfied with the size of our home. She complained that she wished we had a larger space and that there was always something wrong with it. I remember she and my dad would go to countless open houses throughout our small town, dragging me and my brother along. At the time, it was a mere inconvenience for me. I was oblivious and thought they liked doing that as a hobby, simply intrigued by the other houses around our area. I loved our home so much so I never even considered moving out of it and I couldn’t really process the fact that they were antsy to get a larger place. My family is not rich to any degree but I would also never describe myself as coming from a humble beginning as I have led an extremely privileged life thus far. I think that people have become so deeply infatuated with leading an extravagant lifestyle that they become oblivious to the immense abundance that they already have present in their lives. It is true that people need a certain amount of financial security to lead happy and healthy lives, but after a certain threshold of wealth, money will stop producing joy. The mass consumerism of the United States has proven to be detrimental to the climate crisis and this fact does not cease in the case of the housing industry.

<br><hr>
I think everyone in America grows up hearing about big houses, or seeing rich friends with large houses and also wanting mcmansions of your own. I used to draw my dream house as a large home with many unnecessary rooms, a pool, a soccer field backyard, and an in-home movie theatre. I grew up in a two story house, but for my family of five it was modest but comfortable. Yet, I wanted more. I think especially growing up in a low-income family as the daughter of immigrants you want to make your parents proud and be successful in life, which really means being rich, or at least making a good living. And one of the ways to show you’re rich is owning a large house. 
                <br><br>
I feel the exact same as you do. I used to wish I had an enormous house and I used to dream about owning a mansion in the future, but now i'm angry at people who do. As a personal example I love Jeffree Star, but he flies everywhere on private jets, and he owns a castle that is just so unnecessary for one person. He already lived in a mansion, but at the beginning of this year moved into an even bigger mansion, and I was excited to see his tour video but was honestly laughing at how ridiculous all the rooms are for himself and his assistant. I no longer want a large home, and not just because of this class. I can see myself living in a nice comfortable apartment in the city, which is what I’ve wanted anyway so I’m very glad that is the best housing situation you can choose to help the environment. 
                <br><br>
 I would also not be able to live in a co-housing situation, but I also grew up in LA and I absolutely love the city life. But that is just personal preference, but I have many friends who want to live in suburbs and work in the city because they think the city is gross, has too much traffic, and too many people. I think the projections for people living in cities are going to help the crisis because as Ken said city living produces a smaller carbon footprint than suburban areas, but for people who do want to live in suburban areas I think we need more accessible public transportation, so they won’t be driving cars back and forth everyday.
<br><hr>
I agree with part of your opinion. Due to the fact that I grew up in China, it is a country where the amount of apartments is much more significant than the number of houses. Most people in my country will choose to live in an apartment, which is located in the center of a city, instead of the house, which is located in the countryside. Because of this, I believe that it is possible for people to give up the big house and to move into a small apartment. To be honest, an apartment is the most suitable size for a family. Living in a house means that most space is wasted. Also, it reminds me of a type of rivalry that shows up in people’s minds. The bigger house always means that you are richer than people who have a smaller apartment. We must do a reflection about whether we want to buy a big house? For a better living condition? For a better environment? Or just to flaunt that you are more successful? It is a real problem. 
                <br><br>


Tracing to its source, we need to change our mind first before solving all problems about global warming or climate changing. We must admit that consumerism is one of the significant causes of this. If we can change people’s minds from consumerism to a more healthy and frugal living way, I believe that this kind of problem can be solved in the future
<br><hr>

Similarly to you, I’ve always grown up around people, not necessarily my family, but friends’ families and such, complaining and wanting more. I went to a private school in LA until 9th grade, so I was constantly surrounded by huge amounts of wealth, where everyone owned mcmansions. Being one of the few who led a relatively simpler life, constantly being surrounded by people who valued materialistic possessions and held great value on their social appearance, there was a point where I started wanting all those things. I started questioning why my parents didn’t buy a bigger, better, more luxurious house, since that is what all my friends had. I expected things that were so out of the ordinary and started thinking such privileged thoughts, because that has become such a standard in the United States, and especially in LA. However, I quickly realized how insane it was to have such a mentality, when just a few miles away from the crazy Beverly Hills mansions were people struggling to pay rent and make a living. That is the thing with LA and so many big cities in the US. The inequality is frightening. There are the celebrities and people who are extremely rich, but there are also surging numbers of homeless people and even more so just people who are struggling to get by. What angers me so much about that other than the obvious reasons of injustice, the rich people, the ones contributing most to climate change, are the ones with the biggest houses, emitting the most CO2. As you said, people don’t need these huge houses; they are useless and are there simply so that people can show off their wealth and maintain a certain reputation. As Ken mentioned throughout the video, we need to rethink what it means to live a successful life and gear it more towards the climate crisis. 
                <br><br>

Some interesting points that Ken brought up during the lecture were the reasons big houses contribute so much to carbon emissions. I had never stopped to think about it, and also just assumed it was because of how much material and energy is required to build such houses, which in hindsight, wasn’t my smartest thought. I had never thought about how heating and cooling bigger homes obviously is going to contribute more to ecological footprints. Similarly to you, I’m not sure if I could get on board with the whole co-housing concept as Ken described it. I definitely couldn’t share a kitchen with people, but the idea is definitely good and necessary in terms of climate change. If we could come up with a similar idea that didn’t require sharing a living space,I could definitely be on board. However, I completely understand where you’re coming from, having also grown up in LA.

Evident from my previous Environmental classes, including this one, it is evident the problem of housing has become. I think of Kylie Jenner and other Kardashians who often show tours of their houses. Kylie for example, who lives only with her 2-year-old daughter has a house big enough to probably support all of IV. Okay Maybe I am being dramatic, but not really. If you've never seen her house or houses of other celebrities, you should. It's really eye-opening to see what our culture deems important or as a successful lifestyle. Some having shoe closest big enough to be a micro apartment. This is a huge problem and quite frustrating. 
                <br><br>
I like the idea of micro apartments and I can see myself living in one one day. However, one problem with this idea is that the rent for a microapartment in the city would probably cost the same as renting a 3 bedroom house back from where I'm from. This makes is discouraging to get on board with microapartments because I feel like it would be harder to find a roommate to split the costs with because it is so small. If smaller living wants to thrive, prices in rent must be something a person living along or with a significant other can afford, or else I feel like people will look into much bigger spaces where the rent can be split with 4 or 5 other people.
                <br><br>
I remember growing up with 2 brothers and 5 sisters. I had to split one room with all five sisters and it was a nightmare. I remember always thinking I'd get rich one day and buy a huge house all to myself. While this seems silly to me now, I still thrive to have my own space as I grew up with nothing of my own in a low income family with a lot of kids. With that being said, I am on board for things like micro apartments (depending on the rent), but I don't think sharing a house with a whole family is something I'd ever want to do, no matter how much it helped the climate.

I think your comment perfectly shows how the American Dream mindset is still completely relevant, especially when it comes to housing. I have seen many Kar-Jenner house tours as well as many other big house tours, and hate to admit I take inspiration from them. Their houses seem so put together and aesthetically pleasing, and it makes me look forward to having the same thing when I am older. (maybe not  one with 5 guest bedrooms and a movie theatre like theirs, but definitely something larger than a micro-apartment). Your experience growing up with 6 kids to one room would naturally cause you to want a big house one day, because the typical American Dream drilled in our heads is all about making it bigger and better for yourself one day. Even though that dream causes harm, I don't think you or anyone in a similar situation is wrong for wanting more than you now have. It will all just come down to the extent of the dream and how much you act on it... I don't think wealthy people necessarily deserve the amount of excessive stuff they have, but I also don't think they deserve to be told they cannot have it either. Many of them did earn the money they have now and have the right to use it as they wish. My hope is that for the future, people change where they want all of their well-earned money to go. Hopefully billionaires in the future will be donating money to climate movements or other beneficial organizations, as opposed to getting a house for just themself that could fit them and all of their friends and families or buying their 20th car. I think we should go about it in a less forceful way, and instead of bagging on the billionaires with excessive stuff, we should celebrate the billionaires who donate so much.

<br><hr>
I have the same feeling that celebrities are over-exploiting housing resources even though they just constitute a small percentage of global population. I have watched several documentaries by the Kardashians and I was also amazed by their luxury living style. As far as I’m concerned, there is no need to have twenty plus rooms and huge closets to accommodate only two people. It’s worth considering that there are still places in the world where living and survival is a problem. I felt lucky enough that my family could send me abroad to receive higher education, while there is still a decent amount of people who are struggling and can’t get sufficient education. Regarding the idea of micro apartments and co-housing brought out by Ken, I consider to be a novel and good idea which will enhance human connections. This reminds me of the old days in which I often played with my neighbors after school and had dinner at their home. While as I grew up and moved further from them, this connection began to fade off and I start to act more individually. People are fond of individualism and promotes the idea of unique identity. Form my perspective, co-housing is a beneficial idea for us to become tightly connected while saving resources simultaneously.

<br><hr>
I have the same thought. After watching this video, I immediately think of the Kardashian-Jenner families and their mansions which were shown on their YouTube videos, as well as the houses shown by other YouTube celebrities. I have to admit I dreamed about living in that house one day after watching those types of videos, just imaging having the private cinema downstairs my living room although this is might be the luxury extra enjoyment which cannot be called as a necessity of a house. I’ve already learnt how much human’s transportation is contributing to total CO2 emission, but I seldom think of housing can have this large impact on the environment. Heating, washing, cooling and so on, these are the things whose usage become larger as the sizes of houses increase and often being neglected by us. It’s hard to switch your diet habit or transportation choice in relatively a short period, what about to start with the easiest thing you can change? Turning off the lights when leaving might be a good place to start.

<br><hr>
Thanks for your comment! I definitely agree that the aesthetics for some of these celebrity houses we see is the main temptation. Also, I like and appreciate how you note that people shouldn't feel bad for wanting nice things. While this class has been helpful in learning  about ways to live a more sustainable lifestyle, it's also been a little draining because I feel like everything I thought  I ever wanted as an adult is being questioned. However, like you said, I think it's totally fine to want to strive for the finer things in life but while also doing it in a more sustainable way
<br><hr>
thanks for your comment! Is co-housing something you would consider giving a try? I think i'd love to try the micro apartment idea, as I'm not big on sharing my spaces, I just wonder how affordable such a place in the city would be.

<br><hr>

Sure!! I'll give it a try if I have the opportunity to do so, while it seems impossible in my home country. I consider it to be a great opportunity for me to build relationships with my neighbors. It's even better to make it a second home.

The reality is that to make the global change that we need in order to save our planet for as long as we can, each person needs to drastically change their life. This has become more than apparent throughout this course, but the lack of education that people have regarding which of their actions actually have a significant impact was very clearly represented to me through this week’s focus. The large weight that housing has on each person’s individual carbon footprint is not on the forefront of people’s minds. From the conversations I have with other people as well as the general stigma regarding decreasing one’s footprint, I see that driving has the most coverage and is believed to be the largest contributing factor to decreasing one’s individual footprint. Even though it is a part of it, the lack of attention on food production, other forms of transportation, and especially housing is what is contributing to the problem. Moving to cities in my opinion would be a fun and easy way to not only help decrease my individual carbon footprint but also live in a great place. Living in Los Angeles is a headache everytime I drive with not only traffic but also finding parking. When I am in New York city I genuinely love walking everywhere and taking the subway. It makes my life so much easier. I can enjoy getting to my destination in a worry free and consistent way. Unfortunately, my city does not offer the same structure, but I think that this would be an amazing option. Transformation of all of Los Angeles to have reliable and safe public transportation options would be more than ideal, but does not seem possible at this point in time. It is crazy to think that thirty two percent of one’s carbon footprint comes solely from living in a house and people are unaware of how much this takes on their individual carbon footprint. The stigma around some cities makes it more appealing to move there than others, but if people were truly educated of what was comprising their own individual carbon footprint maybe they would be more inclined to move. I wish that there was an online system where one could enter data like how large their house is and a basic premise of their diet as well as other things that contribute to their own carbon footprint, and it could generate a (as accurate as possible) summary of percentages of where their carbon emissions come from. This could show people who already live in cities things they can do to further aid the decrease in their carbon emissions or encourage people to move to cities. Even though the averages are helpful, I feel that they might lack the convincing factor that is unique to each person’s own actions.

I really like the idea of developing micro-apartments in cities. Since the proportion of people living in urban areas is rising, I think offering micro-apartments is a great, sustainable way to house people in cities. In English 22 last year, I remember watching tours of people's micro-apartments and getting very excited because they offered small spaces but still had all the necessities of a typical living space. To me, it is really cool to think that micro-apartments could become the new norm of city living, not just because it would reduce people's carbon footprint though. These micro-apartments have efficient, ingenious designs that make things so much more convenient. For example, some micro-apartments that already exist have beds that fold out from the wall, so when you aren't using the bed you can free up more space for other activities. The main idea that attracts me to the micro-apartment lifestyle is the simplicity and sustainability of it; micro-apartment living discourages owning excessive products and encourages a simpler, more eco-friendly option.
                <br><br>


Although I think micro-apartments are great for specifically younger people in urban areas, co-housing offers an alternative sustainable way of living that I think would be more successful for older folk in suburban and rural areas. Cohousing minimizes people's carbon footprint because they share common areas, like kitchens. Living in a cohousing community provides cheaper eating options since most meals are large and intended for several people and promote a great sense of community with other people in it. For the elder and families, cohousing is a more practical option than micro-apartments, because cohousing focuses on larger spaces that several people can share. Both options, however, excite me to have my own micro-apartment or live in a cohousing community when I graduate because they are both options I would enjoy living in because of the positive environmental impact I would make and the simpler lifestyle I would have.

I also took Eng 22 and I loved the idea of micro apartments! For me personally, they are the most realistic and of-age solution for better and lower costs of living. I think it goes along with the idea of living a more simple life and it would also require people to obtain less things which we've seen the importance of in the weeks of examining the high cost of materialism. My only concern with this idea is that nowadays, no matter what size apartment you get in the city, it's really expensive, so bigger apartments or housing allows for the possibility of having roommates which helps with the cost of rent. In such a small apartment, I'm sure it would still be costly as it's in the city and probably hard for more than 1 person or a couple to be comfortable in. Therefor, I think it's important to somehow lower city cost living if micro apartments were to ever come into existence as the norm of the way to live.

<br><hr>
I took English 22 last quarter as well, and I also had a similar mindset to micro apartments as well! I definitely agree with you that it is a lot more environmentally sustainable than the average American house. I found it shocking when Ken said that the traditional Japanese house that holds 4 people is 1/10th of the average American house...imagine how much of our carbon footprint we could reduce as a country if everyone here lived in houses they have in Japan. It is undeniable, however, that the ideal home nowadays is usually bigger, as bigger homes are often perceived as better; this stems from the idea that if you live in a bigger home, then you are seen as more successful. Although I do understand why this perception is common, it's important that we break this societal view and find alternative housing methods that can help the planet, and micro apartments are a great option.
                <br><br>
I also agree with you that co-housing communities are fantastic alternatives as well. Because people that are co-housing live in a common area, they usually spend time together by cooking, eating, and sharing other amenities. Like you mentioned, this definitely builds a sense of community for housemates and fosters key relationships as well. Ken also added how the idea of co-housing challenges the tradition of the individual; most Americans usually live alone or with immediate family. Co-housing would break that individualistic tradition and allows housemates to expand their social circle and build new communities.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with you. Although in 1950 the average size of house in America was under 1000 square feet, now it’s more than 2500 square feet. By only building a normal house, 80 metric tons of carbon dioxide will be emitted into the atmosphere. More than that, people usually spend 32 percent of their total annual carbon allotment for both heating& cooling, and other energy-related utilizations at home. All of these suggest that people ought to move into cities which have smaller apartments and “greener” transportations. However, right now 55 percent of humans live in cities, which take plenty of space of the Earth's surface. In 2050, it is expected to be two-third of the whole population. Also, combine with the buildings and industries, people usually think of cities as environment nightmare, as Ken mentioned in his lecture.
                <br><br>
However, when people right now want to live in sustainable lives, they don’t need to and shouldn’t live away from cities and stay in wild, just like Thoreau did, for the reason that it will only bring humans caused damages to nature. Rather than that, they should try the methods such as co-housing which shared kitchen and challenge individual living traditions, or just make the cities “greener” by having more plantations in the gardens and around public facilities. Instead of living away from the city to nature, environmental activists nowadays should actually “bring nature to the city,” then having sustainable lifestyles in cities that have more small units and environment-friendly transits such as Manhattan.
<br><hr>
I think the idea of micro-apartments in the city are a much more feasible option than cohousing for most people. The one issue people take with the climate change issue, besides believing it or not, is the restriction of autonomy some of these plans ensure. Micro-apartments does not minimize one's autonomy, but it does force you to reconsider what you declare as valuable or not. Cohousing on the other hand is a good solution for minimizing a group's carbon footprint, I just doubt this option seems attractive to most. People highly value their privacy and that is not something that you would have in a cohousing situation -- at least relative to having your own micro-apartment. However, if you do not care about your own privacy, then cohousing would be great for reducing the economical cost of living and reducing your carbon footprint. 
                <br><br>

We should be promoting as many options as possible to people looking to change their ways and help the environment, but we need to lay out all the concerns and fully inform people on what they are getting themselves into -- otherwise people will just revert.

When thinking about the climate crisis and what I can do to shrink my footprint, I have rarely thought about the impact that my housing situation has on the environment. To hear that transportation, then housing and consumption/stuff accounts for 86% of our carbon footprint is a bigger number than I expected. If green cities are the solution to the amount of CO2 emitted by the housing industry, I think that's wonderful. 80 metric tons of CO2 per house built is a completely unsustainable number. The benefits of green urban living seem ideal for a number of reasons: cheaper pricing, better for the environment, closer to job opportunities and the list goes on. Even with the trend of tiny homes, it is clear that living in a smaller space is better than the average 2,500 square feet home. Suburban living may have been ideal 60 years ago, but now it is important to consider environmental efficiency and sustainability. Why live in a huge house and use a fraction of the space, when you could live in a micro-apartment and use every inch? As Ken mentioned, this idea does relate back to Thoreau. He advocated for having less stuff and living with the essentials. That can be applied not only to shopping/consumption, but also to having a living space that is intentional and efficient, rather than gigantic, half-used and environmentally harmful.

I agree that it’s astonishing that housing, transportation, and human consumption of material things account for 86% of our carbon footprint. It is almost a daunting statistic to internalize because it makes me wonder if we could ever get it down at least 5% let alone less than 50% to make a real change. The 80 metric tons of CO2 that goes into building a house is also a huge number because you also have to take into account all the stuff people fill it up with which adds another significant amount of CO2 to the atmosphere. I also think it’s wonderful that green cities would be a viable option for housing compared to going to the suburbs. 
                <br><br>

The more I think about it, I think that living in micro apartments in green cities would also help with the transportation aspect of reducing our carbon footprint. It may open up the possibilities to bike more and use a metro than to have a car. Most houses aren’t even being maximized in terms of space. People are prone to spend most of their time in some spaces of the house rather than all of it. A lot of homes have a room for a whole dinner table and another room for a smaller dining area when it’s likely that most of the time families will spend their meals at a smaller dining area of the house and rarely in the dinning room where the bigger table is. I would rather live in a tiny house and use up every single portion of space that I have it means making a bigger difference on my overall carbon footprint than live in a big, lonely, empty house.


<br><hr>

well, I also never imagined that housing can also make a contribution to climate change. Just as the statistics you mentioned in your comments, it is really astonishing. But I feel lucky about my preference for housing. I like to live in the city. Because it is more convenient and if I am going to school or work, living in the city can provide me with a better choice. Although the house in the city commonly is smaller than the house in the suburban area, I still prefer city housing. Because a large house causes higher living expenses and needs more energy to clean or maintain. Among the housing in the city, apartments are the most environmentally friendly. Because many people can share the a building without wasting the land, and commonly the space of apartments is smaller than housing in the suburban area, which means the waste space in one’s house will be reduced. My house is an apartment, and I feel good living in it. In the future, I still would like to choose an apartment to live in, not only because it is environmentally friendly, but also it is convenient and comfortable to live in. Also, living in an apartment can offer you a chance to meet more neighbors and friends, which I find is more interesting than living alone in a big house.

I also was shocked by some of the statistics that Ken mentioned earlier in this video. The fact that 17% of the American carbon footprint comes from heating and cooling houses and another 15% comes from other house energy related emissions adding together to form 32% of our carbon footprint relating to homes. In addition to these statistics I was surprised that part of the reason that this percentage is so high is because of a similar migration away from cities similar but not parallel to the move that Thoreau described in his writing about his time on the shore of Walden pond. This move away from cities toward a rural environment was part of the rise to sub-urban housing which has made this 32% statistic so high. As for myself I would definitely be open to living in either a micro-apartment or a co-housing community as I myself would be more than happy to live in a city environment. Even in comparison to living in a sub-urban area, I would choose to live in a city environment especially in a small apartment or a co-housing community. In addition to my personal preferences, the social benefits of living in a city environment and reducing my own carbon footprint would be extremely attractive and I think is something that everyone should value when they make a decision about where to live. In addition to merely reducing my house related carbon footprint, living in a city would promote other sustainable options of living like owning an electric bike instead of a car which would dramatically cut down one's transportation emissions. I think everyone should look at the overall benefits both individual and social to living in a city and make an informed decision to move to a city and away from sub-urban housing.

The amount of CO2 output that our housing is responsible for was also pretty shocking to me that something so essential to our lives that I think a majority of us forget is a large source of our pollution is actually having such a large impact. Personally, at my house in the Winter, we try and not use our heater for the sake of saving money because of how expensive it is to run for large times. Prior to this video, I wasn't aware that on average heating and cooling of houses accounts for on average 17% of the American's carbon footprint. I'm glad that my family and I coincidentally have been reducing our house's CO2 output but had I known these statistics in the past I would've advocated to my parents for more alternative ways to cool and heat our house than just the conventional ac unit or heater. Sadly plenty of other individuals don't know the true impact they are having by turning on their air units like me and just think the only consequences are a couple more dollars at the end of the month for their comfort. One way this 17% output could be reduced is by moving into these micro-apartments that Ken described which being less square footage requires less energy to heat and cool and can also be temperature managed by insulation and windows that create a wind draft throughout the house. These micro-apartments also bost other positives for the environment like minimalism since there is less space to store things people are less likely to collect unnecessary things as they were if they had the spacious suburban houses. Additionally, I've read about people running community gardens on top of their apartment buildings which brings the serenity of nature into the city while also teaching valuable green skills you wouldn't normally receive in the city. I totally support the idea of bringing more nature into the cities to make them more appealing because to solve our climate change issue it's going to take rewiring the way we think or look at things in society. Since cities are easier to live a more environmentally friendly lifestyle then we must break the stigma that city living is ugly and a hustle and that it can be just as beautiful and great as the suburbs.

The American dream ideal has shifted into the idea that bigger is better. Many Americans are breaking their backs and working excessive hours to try and obtain this dream. However, this transformed ideal is not only causing Americans to feel stress and pressure, it is also negatively affecting the environment. Houses are now supersizing by x2 ½ rate from 1000sq feet to 2,500sq feet. The production of these large homes emits 80 metric tons of carbon. This is a large carbon footprint that highly surpasses the 2 metric tons each American is supposed to ideally emit. The Japanese home is 1/10 of the size of the average American home. Housing and transportation as Ken noted, is responsible for 86% of our carbon footprint.
                <br><br>


There are solutions. There are alternatives. Before hearing of Co-housing I had watched a video about the lifestyle. This lifestyle included the idea of sharing meals, at least x4 a week. People would take turns cooking and cleaning for each other, neighbors would share food products and grow sustainable vegetables. People also lived in small homes. The people in the video were very happy and seemed relaxed with no stress. This community seems like a dream, yet most Americans look at co-housing very negatively. The cultural problem with Americans is the selfishness and competition that fosters from desiring the dream. Many Americans want large houses to live in on their own or with one significant other. But why can't we foster a community and share products and help the plant? What about micro-apartments? The planet can largely benefit from a smaller carbon footprint by people living in smaller homes. The most difficult part of evoking change in living habits will be convincing people that it is not frowned upon to live in a smaller home or a city and that it is actually beneficial for people now and future generations.

When watching this lecture, I became very interested in Ken's perspective on urban living as a form of climate activism and an important aspect to the mitigation of climate change. Although it is not often talked about in regards to a sustainable lifestyle, living in a city seems to actually be one of the most environmentally-friendly things each of us could do. As Ken pointed out, those of the older generations who followed the lead of Thoreau and moved out of cities and into more rural areas in an attempt to get "back to nature" actually ended up creating suburbs that lend themselves to very unsustainable lifestyles where most transportation is done by car and the average size of housing is much more than that of the cities that they left behind. Moreover, living in a city seems to only be getting more environmentally friendly, as exemplified by the Adapt NYC micro-apartment competition and other similar projects occurring in other major U.S. cities. In addition, the emerging trend of co-housing will allow city-dwellers to live in even smaller spaces and share amenities with neighboring units, thus increasing the sustainability of city living even more. 
                 <br><br>

Though many of the ideas expressed in this lecture made me interested in urban living as a sustainable and environmentally-friendly lifestyle, the idea of "re-greening" was perhaps most intriguing. First of all, Ken mentioned the greenways of New York and Paris, which I think are great ways to repurpose abandoned railways and place some nature into the everyday lives of city-dwellers. Additionally, things like chicken coops and rooftop gardens are great projects for individuals or small groups of urbanites to enhance their own lives, while also increasing the sustainability of their urban lifestyles. Overall, I hope that the trend of "re-greening" cities continues, and that it encourages more people to move to cities and begin to live a sustainable, urban life.

I also found this idea of living in a city to seem counter intuitive, in regards to environmentalism. However the points Ken made convinced me that living in a city is one of the best things you can do in regards to housing to help sustain the Earth. I think this stems from the fact that in a city everything is compacted to where all the essential places in someones life are very close together. This then results in a lack of a need for transportation by cars, as often in big cities taking a train or even walking can sometimes be faster than driving a car. I think when you think cities in regards to environmentalism people often think cities are overcrowded which leads to pollution, along with natural land being built over for urban purposes. While there is some truth to this I believe that if we can adapt our current cities to meet modern day environmental standards, the narrative will shift to cities with large populations being very environmentally friendly places to live. I also thought the idea of "re-greening" to be interesting. I think people are naturally drawn to nature and as Ken discussed this is what lead to the creation of suburbs which have been proven to be harmful to the environment. However bringing the environment into existing cities is shown to increase peoples overall happiness along with re purposing locations that are no longer being used in cities.

I completely agree.  This lecture really shows the amazing new options of this form of environmental activism.  I really love the focus on eco-nurturing that takes what developments we have within our urban environments and makes the city green.  It is such a powerful thing to be able to make our cities even more environmentally friendly because as you said, cities are already more environmentally friendly than suburban and rural locals.  Through this video it is really eye opening to see exactly what urban locals have to offer, everything seems to be very adaptable and things have multiple uses.  This in turn minimizes the amount of stuff that people need.  In addition, it is able to solve other environmental issues such as the problem with transportation.  For cities, it simply makes more sense to walk, bike, or use public transportation rather than drive.  This is because not only are individuals’ jobs there in the city, but it is also faster to not use cars as there is heavy, slow traffic.
                 <br><br>

While this video primarily focussed on urban housing as a solution, as you have addressed, I also thought it was great to include co-housing.  That is a very interesting topic and concept, which not many in the United States are too familiar with.  It always seems like Europe is a leading innovator when it comes to developments or cultural changes to benefit environmental issues.  They are typically ahead of the curve, and we in the US should start taking notes on things we should implement.  The effects are widespread and positive though, allowing for more community and helping people socially, financially, and more.
                 <br><br>

I would definitely love to see more of the movement back to urban areas and the greening of these locals, in addition to the increase of co-housing.  These solutions are not only those to the housing issue of the climate crisis, but also several others which include transportation, stuff, and several others including land use.  If we are able to implement solutions to the housing component, then we will be able to make changes that are widespread, allowing for an increased positive impact.  I definitely support this new environmental activism and think that this is what we need to make the necessary changes.

I was already more inclined towards living in the city as opposed to living in rural areas before watching this lecture. However, I was not aware of the various climate benefits that come with city living. Most people including myself think that living in the city is more environment unfriendly than living in rural areas. The reason is probably because of the stigma associated with city living: large amount of people and vehicles emitting wastes. However, after watching the lecture, it has become apparent to me that living in rural areas cause more environmental damage than living in large cities. Living in suburbs and rural areas is unsustainable simply because of the amount of transportation by cars is needed.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with you. When I was studying in Engl22 last term, we learned a lot about pastoral poems, which show the beauty of the rural areas and the critics on cities due to pollution. These poems encouraged people back at that time to move from cities to the “natural world”. However, these movements, like Back to Nature, turned out that they simply brought some city problems to nature and made those places also uninhabitable. After knowing that, I could not help thinking whether there is any possible way to get a better life on this planet? Or just move to another planet, or wait to be extinct. Fortunately, I found it interesting and hopeful when Ken mentioned that moving to cities can help mitigate the climate crisis. I used to think that living in cities will only increase the population and pollution. However, things like micro-apartments and co-housing are appealing to me. As a person who likes staying with friends, I believe it will be an excellent experience to live with my good friends in a co-housing. In this way, by helping each other, people can get to know each other better.
                  <br><br>

Moreover, regarding the idea of “re-greening”, I also found it an intriguing practice. Especially the part of the rooftop garden, although it might be impractical now (actually, I think things like rooftop gardens only belong to the rich), I believe we will find better ways soon. However, I still show doubt about some of the ideas mentioned in the video. If there are a huge population and limited space, are these goals still achievable? All in all, this video put forward a new way to mitigate the climate crisis and give us one more right direction.

Just as what you said in your comment, I also found that it is a totally new perspective of viewing the climate change. It is surprising but also reasonable that many of the old generation followed Thoreau to move to the rural area to live a simple and environmentally friendly lifestyle. However, in fact what they do actually do harm to the environment, because they did I not get the core point of Thoreau’s action of moving to countryside. Live in the city or by the lake does not really matter for Thoreau to live that kind of simple life. 
                  <br><br>

 However, I believe that even till now, there are still someone who still think they should move to the countryside in order to be environmentally friendly, because they do not have the chance to have course and knowledge. Thus it should be our responsibility to inform more and more people that it is good to live in small apartments in cities instead of in the countryside. Only if more and more people know this and actually move to small apartment in cities can really limit the carbon footprint tp 1/10

Yes, living in the city does seem like a simpler way to live an environmentally friendly lifestyle. I grew up in a small rural town in Fowler, CA, where public transportation did not cross the mind of a good 90% of the population; it was just not an efficient alternative to driving cars. The fact that we had a lot of open land for crops really made homes spread apart. Some of my peers in high school lived in the countryside without any neighbors at all. On the other hand, living in cities with much larger populations urges people to walk and use public transportation because it is more efficient to do so. Living in micro-apartments could bring a lot of people together as well, forming tight knit communities along the way. City living has been one of my biggest life goals because I've never been able to have the exposure a larger environment grants. Knowing that I would be decreasing my carbon footprint in doing so urges me even more to make that a reality in the future. 
                  <br><br>

The topic of greening cities presented ways I would be able to live a sustainable life in the city, and opened my eyes to what activists are now doing in places of well-known pollution. I can say I did/do view the city as a place of more pollution and bad air quality compared to places with an abundance of nature, but now that I see that there are movements and activists doing their part in creating a more sustainable and environmentally friendly life, my gears are switched. I hope to live in the city and have my own garden because it would not only be "green," but make my wallet happy as well.

I also became interested in this perspective on urban living as climate activism, because up until now I had always seen cities as a huge proprietor of the issue. When I think of cities I think of pollution, waste, traffic as opposed to the nature aspect of living in rural or suburban areas. I then realized that people in suburbs still are producing the same amount, probably even more, pollution, waste, and automobile use, it just isn’t as noticeable because it is spread out. After learning more about how moving to cities could help reduce our climate footprint, I think it could be a great idea. I like how you touched upon the “Thoreau” part that Ken mentioned, because to me that was the most interesting part of the lecture. I found it fascinating how the suburban crawl was spurred on in part by Thoreau’s call to reconnect with nature and get away from hectic city life. If Thoreau was alive I wonder if he really would recommend we go back to cities, knowing what we know now about the climate crisis and what is truly causing it. However I think Thoreau was touching upon more of the psychological implications of resorting back to nature than the environmental effects, even though he did mention those as well. 
                  <br><br>

I also think “re-greening” could be a great solution to helping turn cities into a more sustainable and nature oriented area. I think that by connecting nature and cities, instead of treating them like they have to be in opposition, a lot more people will want to live in cities. We definitely should be taking advantage of rooftop space and abandoned railroads or buildings, because we need to help restore nature in any way that we can. I think that if we can make city living seem more desirable to the public again instead of a suburban way of life, we could seriously reduce our carbon footprints. However just because someone lives in a city doesn’t mean they still don’t have a huge house, lots of cars, produce a lot of waste, etc. The focus needs to be on smaller and sustainable living; which just happens to be easier in cities due to the close proximity of everything.

Shifting to a culture in which people choose or want to live smaller seems near impossible. For lifetimes we have been taught that bigger is better and that owning property is key to the “American Dream”. It’s both shocking and frustrating to hear Ken say that our average housing alone takes up two and a half times the suggested carbon allowment. Again, taking the issue into consideration as a lifestyle or cultural problem is best as specifically the people engaged in this topic and class are very likely considering stable or semi-permanent housing options within this decade. This is why i’m glad you mention the pros of co-housing, where people are able to share amenities and certain services leading to a direct reduction in their carbon footprint. Unfortunately, society seems to place a negative stigma in that of sharing spaces or owning less where people are often seen as financially unstable enough to purchase a ‘big enough’ home or property for just themselves. This negative perspective on how much and what people own can only really be changed within ourselves; and because housing options are likely ones we will be debating soon it’s important to take into consideration the impact our planet will be having based off our lifestyle needs. 

                  <br><br>

As for Thoreau’s time living “small”, I think in many ways can be accomplished in an urban setting just as much as a wilderness one. I take as an example the concept and those participating in a “minimalist” lifestyle. In a prior film viewing we were given many examples and alternatives as to how some go about reducing their waste and at time indirectly their carbon footprint by taking a closer look at their consumption rate and amount. In my opinion this could be seen as a modern take on Thoreau’s ideology where one consumes and produces only what they truly believe to be sustainable and logical for ones’ self.

I agree with your comment Esteban, I was appalled to hear that an average American home takes up 2.5 times the suggested carbon allotment. It is insane to hear that in America one in five new homes being built are now over 3000 square feet, and then to hear that a traditional home in China that houses 4 or more people is only 1/10 that amount shows how greedy we have become. We want and strive for these huge beautiful homes that are unnecessary especially for some families. I also enjoyed how Professor Hiltner listed off the pros and cons of co-housing because it is something I have never heard of and I am sure a lot of others also haven’t. It is important to get these alternative lifestyles out there, so everyone knows their options. It is definitely a weird living situation to most if not all people because most think “why share my house when I can afford to live alone?” which is why it is important to educate the public on how terrible it is for the environment to own a huge home just for yourself. There are so many things people can do to reduce their footprints like reducing the size of your home, use public transportation more, eating less meat, and thrift shopping. Although in order to do these things we have to learn to be less selfish, greedy, and learn to not always go with the convenient options (single use plastics, having your own car, etc.). 
                   <br><br>

I also agree with your statement about Thoreau’s minimalistic approach. It is definitely something that can be accomplished in today’s society and in our cities. All it takes is giving up some of our convinces in life, as well as looking into how to reduce our individual carbon footprints.

<br><Hr>
I really appreciate your comment on the video because it is comprehensive and insightful. You mention that “shifting to a culture in which people choose or want to live smaller seems near impossible,” because “for lifetimes we have been taught that bigger is better and that owning property is key to the ‘American Dream’.” However, “our average housing alone takes up two and a half times the suggested carbon level.” In order to solve the problem, Ken advises us to move into micro apartments in cities, and I think it is a sustainable way to reduce our carbon emission. Ken also says that the concept of living in small areas is similar to Thoreau’s idea of “minimalism”. According to you, “many ways can be accomplished in an urban setting just as much as a wilderness one.” Indeed, if we give up things that are unnecessary in our daily lives, we can efficiently reduce our footprint on the environment.
